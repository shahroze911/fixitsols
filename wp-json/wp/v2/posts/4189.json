It\u2019s crucial to demonstrate and prove your finances for a student visa. Moreover, this also includes that after paying first year tuition fees, a student must have enough money to support his living cost for at least nine months. To facilitate this, Pakistani students are encouraged to work with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/organisations\/uk-visas-and-immigration\">UKVI <\/a>approved banks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These banks are authorized by the UK government to issue the necessary financial documents that prove you have the required funds for your studies.
