Moreover, they can speak and understand English (English language test (IELTS, PTE, Duolingo, etc.).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"When_should_you_apply_for_a_UK_study_visa\"><\/span><strong>When should you apply for a UK study visa?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The best time to apply for a UK study visa from Pakistan is 3 months before the start of your course at a UK university. You will usually get visa approval or rejection within 3 weeks. So, it&#8217;s best to apply ahead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Whats_the_best_time_to_arrive_in_the_UK\"><\/span><strong>What&#8217;s the best time to arrive in the UK?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The best time to arrive in the UK for a short course, such as 6 months or less, is a week in advance. However, if your course is longer than 6 months, you should arrive up to 30 days before commencing your classes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Child_Study_Visa\"><\/span><strong>Child Study Visa<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Students aged less than 16 and more than 4 need a sponsor to study in the UK.

You must have a CAS letter from a UK university. Financial evidence, including your course fee and living expenses, is also necessary. Besides that, you should have proof of English language proficiency to speak, read, and understand English. Here&#8217;s the detail of each step and requirement for a UK study visa:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1_Select_Your_Course_and_University\"><\/span>1. <strong>Select Your Course and University<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;The first step to securing a UK study visa from Pakistan is to find the right course and university. Is it overwhelming, right? That&#8217;s not a big deal if you have the best education consultants at your back. Apply for the universities and get an unconditional offer letter from a UK university approved by the UK government. Here are the steps you need to follow:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Contact EduCrest Migration to select the right course and university for upcoming intakes.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>We will assign you to our expert UK study consultants, who will guide you through the courses, universities, fee structures, and ranking.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The next step is applying to those universities; we will need little documentation, such as certificates and degrees, CNIC, SOP, and others, to submit the applications to universities.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It&#8217;s best to complete all the requirements, such as CGPA, <a href=\"https:\/\/ielts.org\/\">IELTS<\/a> or other English proficiency tests, to get an unconditional offer letter. If you receive a conditional offer letter, you need to meet the university&#8217;s conditions to have an unconditional offer.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>After the offer letter, you may be asked to submit the initial deposit and do a university interview. It&#8217;s not a big deal, as our <a href=\"https:\/\/educrestmigration.com\/\">best education consultants in Islamabad<\/a>, Pakistan will guide you through everything.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Get_a_Confirmation_of_Acceptance_CAS\"><\/span>2. <strong>Get a Confirmation of Acceptance (CAS)<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The next step is to get the CAS letter from the university. After receiving the unconditional offer letter, you need to share a few more documents with your university. After their submission, the university will issue a CAS letter, and then you can apply for a UK study visa from Pakistan. Here&#8217;s what you need to share with your university:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Initial deposit receipt (usually 4000 GBP; the more you submit, the more chances you have for CAS and VISA).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>TB test report from UKVI-approved TB test centres in Pakistan.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bank statement of 28 days (no less than 31 days old).

This letter is proof of your admission to a UK university, showing a unique reference number and university details.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Financial_Requirements_for_UK_Student_Visa\"><\/span>3. <strong>Financial Requirements for UK Student Visa<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>You must show proof of finances to apply for a UK study visa from Pakistan.

A biometric residence permit (BRP) acts like a CNIC in the UK. It confirms your identity, study rights, and access to any public service. It includes your name, date, place of birth, face, and fingerprints. Besides, it also includes your purpose of staying in the UK. \u00a0What types of services, such as NHS, can you access and what expiry date?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can collect your BRP after arriving in the UK. Collect your BRP before the vignette sticker expires or within 10 days of arrival in the UK. The decision letter includes the name of the post office branch or sponsor from which you can collect the BRP. Remember to bring your passport and travel documents to collect the BRP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Some_Major_Considerations\"><\/span><strong>Some Major Considerations<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Start your visa application process at least three months before your course start date.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make sure the information you provide is valid and latest.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maintain communication with the university or relevant education consultant for any query.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You need keen attention to detail while filing a visa application.
