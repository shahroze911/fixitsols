The IHS fee differs from all other fees you pay during your Visa application process. It usually costs \u00a31,035 for the principal applicant and \u00a3776 for students and children <strong>from 6th February 2024<\/strong> according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/healthcare-immigration-application\">UK Government<\/a>. The IHS cost is the same for adult dependents as the primary visa application. Besides, the amount of IHS depends upon the period you are applying for. You won&#8217;t get a Visa if you haven&#8217;t paid the immigration health surcharge. If the wrong amount is paid being paid, the embassy can delay your UK Visa.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_80 counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter ez-toc-grey

process of the Immigration Health Surcharge?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you pay the immigration health surcharge or are exempt from paying it, you can take national health services in the UK. In short, if you have a visa of more than six months, IHS is a must, and you will get the treatment from an NHS hospital like an ordinary resident of England. However, certain services, such as prescriptions, dental treatment, and eye treatment, won&#8217;t be free won&#8217;t be free. But, if your Visa ends earlier than planned, you will be charged for any <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nhs.uk\/\">NHS<\/a> hospital treatment from the time your Visa ends. Besides, if you renew your Visa, you will still pay the charges for any treatment you get after the end of your previous Visa.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, if you apply for an extension of your Visa, you must pay the IHS further. Similarly, you won&#8217;t have to pay the surcharge if you apply for leave to remain. Consequently, paying the immigration health surcharge does not mean you will get the treatment faster, but it means you can avail of all the services provided by NHS. Doctors will treat you the same way as ordinary residents, and you will be treated according to the urgency of your condition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Other Useful Content: <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/educrestmigration.com\/study-abroad\/list-of-ukvi-approved-banks-in-pakistan-to-study-in-uk\/\">List of UKVI Approved Banks in Pakistan to Study in UK<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/educrestmigration.com\/study-abroad\/tuberculosis-testing-in-pakistan-for-uk-visa-guide-for-tb-test\/\">Tuberculosis testing in Pakistan for UK Visa \u2013 Guide for TB Test<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-large-font-size\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Why_Do_You_Have_to_Pay_the_IHS_for_a_VISA\"><\/span><strong>Why Do You Have to Pay the IHS for a VISA?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are not from the UK, such as a Pakistani student or worker trying to apply for a UK Visa, you must pay IHS first. If your period of stay in the UK is more than 6 months, paying IHS is a must. However, if you are applying for a permanent stay in the UK, then the case is different. Besides, if you are applying for entry clearance of 6 months or less, you must have private health insurance with you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are applying from within the UK, paying for an immigration health surcharge is a must in case of a Visa extension, even if it&#8217;s for less than 6 months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-large-font-size\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Immigration_Health_Surcharge_Exemption\"><\/span><strong>Immigration Health Surcharge Exemption<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use the National Health Services without paying the immigration health surcharge if:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Applicants for health and care visas, including their dependents, are exempt from IHS.

The Visa can last longer than your study duration and employment period. The charge is <strong>\u00a3776 per year for students for stays lasting 6\u201312 months<\/strong> and <strong>\u00a3388 for additional periods of less than 6 months<\/strong>. <strong>\u00a3776 <\/strong>for visa and immigration applications under 18.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u00a31,035 <\/strong>per year for all other visa applications. Moreover, all other applicants must pay <strong>\u00a3517.50 <\/strong>for additional periods of less than 6 months. If you are applying for over 6 months but less than a year, you must pay the full-year IHS Visa Fee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Example_1\"><\/span><strong>Example 1:<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are enrolling in a 12-month course, your Visa will typically start one month before the course begins and extend to cover the course duration plus an additional four months. This makes your Visa valid for 17 months, requiring you to pay an IHS fee of <strong>\u00a31,164 (\u00a3776 + \u00a3388)<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Example_2\"><\/span><strong>Example 2:<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a three-year undergraduate degree program, the IHS fee is <strong>\u00a3776 per year<\/strong> of your course, plus <strong>\u00a3388<\/strong> for the additional time included in your Visa before and after your course. This totals <strong>\u00a32,716<\/strong> over three years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IHS ensures access to healthcare services throughout your stay in the UK.

It will give you the guidelines on how to pay IHS. The email address will be the same as you put in for the visa application. After receiving the email, you must pay the surcharge within 10 working days if you are in the UK and within seven working days if you are from another country like Pakistan. If the IHS fee is not submitted within the given timespan, your visa application will be turned down immediately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-large-font-size\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_to_Pay_the_Immigration_Health_Surcharge_from_Pakistan\"><\/span><strong>How to Pay the Immigration Health Surcharge from Pakistan?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to pay the immigration health surcharge on the date of submission of your visa application. Usually, it comes within the online application form for most visas. As a result, it is impossible to file for a visa without paying the IHS fee. You may need to give the start and end details from the certificate of sponsorship. Or you may need to add the course dates if you are applying for a student visa. After finalizing your application form, you will see a page to pay IHS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After paying that, you will receive an email with the IHS reference number. You can only use this number once; if you are applying again for VISA, you may need to pay IHS again to get this reference number. After that, you will be returned to the form to make the application fee next. You need a credit or debit card for this. Note that you can&#8217;t apply with cash and bank transfers unless you are a resident of North Korea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-large-font-size\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Whats_the_Procedure_for_an_IHS_Fee_Refund\"><\/span><strong>What&#8217;s the Procedure for an IHS Fee Refund?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will get the full IHS fee refund in case:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Suppose you have paid the IHS fee twice or more for the same Visa.

For example, if you paid for 20 months, the refund will be 18 months of IHS. Paying twice for less than 6 months of IHS is not entitled to any refund.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-large-font-size\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_Will_I_Get_the_Refund_and_How_long_will_it_Take\"><\/span><strong>How Will I Get the Refund, and How long will it Take?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t need to take any action if you are entitled to a partial or full IHS refund.

However, if you appeal the visa application refusal and ask for a review, the refund can take longer.
