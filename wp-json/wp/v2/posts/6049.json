However, they were just the overview. Malaysia is the 11th best study-abroad destination for international students, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unesco.org\/en\/higher-education\">UNESCO<\/a>. It is a growing country with a progressive economy and the best education system that is recognized worldwide.

Reasons, Requirements, and More!<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, Malaysia has low living costs and tuition fees with scenic views and the safest environment. So, who wouldn\u2019t like to go there and pursue their career? Here are some major opportunities which you can get as a Pakistani student while studying in Malaysia:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Part-time_Work_Opportunities_in_Malaysia_for_Pakistani_Students\"><\/span><strong>Part-time Work Opportunities in Malaysia for Pakistani Students<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Students cannot work part-time during their semester in Malaysia. However, they can go for it during semester breaks for up to 20 hours per week. For legitimate reasons, you can go for part-time work but with a cash-on-hand basis. Some Malaysian universities do offer paid internships during the semester. That\u2019s another way to earn some bucks during your stay in Malaysia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Cost_to_Study_in_Malaysia_from_Pakistan\"><\/span><strong>Cost to Study in Malaysia from Pakistan<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Malaysia promises the highest quality education while offering a cost-effective fee and living expenses. Moreover, all of the Malaysian universities have lower tuition fees than the UK, United States, Japan, and even Singapore. Besides, the living cost is affordable. You can easily get on-campus accommodation for only $150 per month. However, considering the other living expenses such as food, travelling, entertainment, laundry, and stationery, you need at least RM 1200 per month. The tuition cost of Malaysian universities may vary depending on their rankings and quality of education. However, you can expect the per semester cost from RM 10,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Study_in_Malaysia_Without_IELTS\"><\/span><strong>Study in Malaysia Without IELTS<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many universities in Malaysia offer students the option of PTE and IELTS.

For Masters, many <a href=\"https:\/\/educrestmigration.com\/english-proficiency-test\/study-in-uk-universities-without-ielts-for-pakistani-students\/\">universities accept MOI <\/a>(Medium of Instruction) from Pakistani Universities. So, you won\u2019t need to take IELTS but submit an English Proficiency Certificate from your previous university. However, for Bachelor\u2019s and Diploma degree programs, IELTS is a must. But you can check for other English test options as well.
