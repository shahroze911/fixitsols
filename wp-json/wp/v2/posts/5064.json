This act by universities ensures you have enough funds to support your tuition fees and living expenses in the UK. Therefore, when applying for a student visa, it&#8217;s essential to submit financial documents showing the requisite funds for 28 consecutive days. You need to submit the financial statement with the application for a UK study visa from Pakistan. Only then will the university sponsor you and issue CAS (confirmation of acceptance of studies). Submitting the bank statement is crucial whether you are applying for undergraduate or postgraduate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_80 counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter

class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_is_a_Bank_Statement_for_UK_Study_VISA\"><\/span><strong>What is a Bank Statement for UK Study VISA?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A bank statement is a document issued by your bank showing that you have enough funds to stay and study in the UK. Simply put, a bank statement is a record of your bank account activity over some period. It shows the flow of your cash, debits, and credits for a specific period. However, the amount required for a bank statement for UK study visa should stay the same. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than asking how much the bank statement is for a UK student visa from Pakistan, you also need a letter from the bank. This letter shows the total amount available and the duration of the bank statement. Moreover, the bank statement also includes the bank&#8217;s signature and statement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_Much_Bank_Statement_is_Required_for_a_UK_Student_Visa\"><\/span><strong>How Much Bank Statement is Required for a UK Student Visa?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the bank statement for UK study visa, you need to show that you have enough funds for living and tuition. You must show that the funds were in your account for 28 days. Moreover, the bank statement must not be more than 31 days old from the date you submit the bank statement. However, the UK visa requirements from Pakistan depend upon your course duration and location.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The major bank statement can include your course fees, living costs, and your partner or child&#8217;s living cost if they come with you as a dependent. Here is the break-down of your financial requirements for a UK study visa:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Course_Fees\"><\/span><strong>Course Fees:<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Show proof that you have the full tuition fee in your account for the first year or the entire course. The amount is usually shown on <strong>the CAS letter<\/strong> you receive from your university.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Your CAS usually shows the initial deposit, for example, \u00a34000. Now, you need to show the remaining fee in the bank statement for the UK study visa.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Total tuition fees usually range from <strong>\u00a310,000 to \u00a340,000 per year<\/strong> or more, depending upon your university and course. Undergraduate programs typically have lower costs than postgraduate programs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Living_Costs\"><\/span><strong>Living Costs:<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If you are studying <strong>in London<\/strong>, you must have <strong>\u00a31,483 for each month<\/strong> (this includes the maximum duration of 9 months). Thus, you will need to have and show <strong>\u00a313,347 (<\/strong>\u00a31,483 X 9).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>For <strong>outside London<\/strong>, you need to have <strong>\u00a31,136<\/strong> for each month (up to a maximum of nine months). This means you will need to have and show <strong>\u00a310,224<\/strong> (\u00a31,136 X 9).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Living_Cost_for_Dependents\"><\/span><strong>Living Cost for Dependents:<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If you are studying outside London, you need to show <strong>\u00a3680<\/strong> for each month (a 9-month maximum duration). The mean <strong>\u00a36,120<\/strong> (\u00a3680 X 9).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>\u00a3845<\/strong> each month for studying in London (a maximum of 9 months). This is the mean, <strong>\u00a37,605<\/strong> (\u00a3845 X 9).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"UK_Visa_Price_in_Pakistan_for_Students\"><\/span><strong>UK Visa Price in Pakistan for Students<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The UK student visa fees from Pakistan depend upon your course duration. If you are applying from inside the UK and want to extend and switch to a student VISA, the fee is \u00a3490. Moreover, you will also need to pay \u00a3490 if you apply for a study visa outside of the UK. In short, Pakistani students must pay \u00a3490 to apply for a student visa to the UK. However, this amount is not included in the bank statement for UK study visa. You can pay this amount from any bank account in Pakistan or outside.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_are_Parked_Funds\"><\/span><strong>What are Parked Funds?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Parked funds are the amount in a specific bank account for some time, for example, 28 days. This amount is to meet the visa rules. However, you must show that the amount is yours by showing the bank account in your name and its number. After getting the Visa, you can use the money. Moreover, it&#8217;s essential to save money before your visa application. Saving too little time to get the Visa can result in rejection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Can_I_Show_the_Online_Bank_Statement_for_UK_Student_VISA\"><\/span><strong>Can I Show the Online Bank Statement for UK Student VISA?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use the online bank statement for UK study VISA from Pakistan. However, the acceptable bank statement for a UK visa must meet some requirements. The statement should be an official document with the bank&#8217;s letterhead, stamp, and signature. Moreover, it should clearly show the account holder&#8217;s details. This means that if you submit an online bank statement, you must print it out and get the bank&#8217;s approval with a stamp and signature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bank statement should also include a period of 28 days. The funds in the account should show that you can afford to live and study in the UK. You may also require a cover letter from the bank with your details on it (account number, name, amount, etc.).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_to_Give_Financial_Evidence\"><\/span><strong>How to Give Financial Evidence?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Providing a bank statement for UK study VISA is not enough to get the Visa. You must prove that the financial income is your own. You can give the financial evidence by using:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Personal Account:<\/strong> Your bank account (current or savings account) should be in the form of a bank statement and a letter from the bank with your name, bank name, and amount.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Partner&#8217;s Account:<\/strong> Your partner&#8217;s bank account (spouse) if they are in the UK or going with you.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Parent&#8217;s Bank Account:<\/strong> Your parent&#8217;s bank account with the confirmation letter.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Official Sponsorship:<\/strong> The money from your official sponsor, if any (for example, the government of Pakistan or a University). The financial sponsor is usually recorded on CAS; if not, you must provide a confirmation letter with the sponsor&#8217;s name, contact, amount, date, and sponsorship period.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A Joint Account:<\/strong> A joint account with anyone (brother, sister, parents) but with a letter of confirmation that they agree to use it for bank statements.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Loan Amount:<\/strong> A loan amount from the government of Pakistan or a company\/scheme offering student loans. (a loan confirmation letter with the amount within 6 months of applying).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Financial_Documents_Required_for_UK_Study_VISA\"><\/span><strong>Financial Documents Required for UK Study VISA<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Applying for a UK study visa from Pakistan includes submitting financial documents to prove that you can support yourself financially. For that reason, you need to submit your monetary documents to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/guidance\/financial-evidence-for-student-and-child-student-route-applicants\">UKVI<\/a>. Here&#8217;s the list of those:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Original bank statement:<\/strong> Your bank statement should include your name, account details, bank letterhead, transaction history, stamp, and signature. It shouldn&#8217;t be more than 31 days old.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bank Letter:<\/strong> You also need to submit a letter from the bank confirming the validity of your bank statement. The letter should include your name, statement period, account details, and amount.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Proof of Income:<\/strong> You must provide pay slips or other income-proof documents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Scholarship\/Sponsorship Letter: <\/strong>If someone sponsors you, you must submit a confirmation letter with the amount they will sponsor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Letter from Loan Organization: <\/strong>If you are getting a loan, submit the loan approval letters from the relevant company or organization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Proof of Property:<\/strong> If you are using property, you must also include the evidence of property.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Certificates of Deposit:<\/strong> You must also submit proof if you have a fixed deposit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure the documents are in their original form and clearly include your details. Moreover, the transaction history should be from the last 28 days, and the bank statement for UK study visa from Pakistan should not be older than 31 days. Also, remember to accompany the bank confirmation letter for the statement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_28_Days_Rule\"><\/span><strong>The 28 Days Rule<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To apply for a UK student Visa from Pakistan, your bank statement should consist of 28 consecutive days. The maintenance amount must have been in your account or your guardian&#8217;s account for the last 28 days. During these 28 days, the amount should not be less than the requisite amount. Any transactions you make should not affect the remaining amount on the statement, or your application will be refused. The counting for 28 days will start from the closing balance to the back and should not be more than 31 days old.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, the finances in the letter from the bank and the closing balance should match and cannot be older than 31 days. The date of the visa application is not the date on which your bank statement should start. UKVI can ask you for the bank statement while processing your visa application.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_to_Do_in_Case_of_Insufficient_Funds\"><\/span><strong>What to Do in Case of Insufficient Funds?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Suppose you do not have enough funds to show in the bank statement for UK study visa to seek education in the UK. Then, you can apply for a scholarship. Many universities in the UK offer scholarships specifically for Pakistani students. For that, you can use the best <a href=\"https:\/\/educrestmigration.com\/\">education consultants in Islamabad<\/a>. They will guide you through the universities, scholarships, and requirements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another option is to get a loan. Many organizations in Pakistan offer student loans. You can grab the loan and then study and work in the UK to return it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of all the options, the best choice is to consult with the best study abroad consultants in Islamabad and get expert advice. They won&#8217;t only help you find the best study options with scholarships but will also assist you with Visas. Moreover, they will guide you on how to live, work, and blend in the UK&#8217;s culture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Frequently_Asked_Questions\"><\/span><strong>Frequently Asked Questions<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Who_Does_Not_Need_to_Submit_the_Bank_Statement_for_UK_Study_Visa\"><\/span><strong>Who Does Not Need to Submit the Bank Statement for UK Study Visa?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You do not need to submit the bank statement and meet financial requirements if:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You are applying for a student visa from within the UK.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You are already living in the UK and have a valid visa for 12 months or more on the date you apply for a new UK study Visa.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, keep in mind that not everyone can apply for a UK student visa; therefore, it&#8217;s best to check the requirements before submitting a visa application. Moreover, even if a government or international scholarship organization is supporting you financially, you need to submit written consent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Who_Must_Need_to_Meet_the_Financial_Requirements_Without_Submitting_Financial_Documents\"><\/span><strong>Who Must Need to Meet the Financial Requirements Without Submitting Financial Documents?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have the nationality of the countries available in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/guidance\/immigration-rules\/immigration-rules-appendix-student\">Appendix ST, paragraph 22.1 of the Immigration Rules<\/a>, you must meet the financial requirements.

In this way, they consider that you will benefit from differentiation arrangements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The university won&#8217;t need to check the financial statement and will issue the CAS if you apply from within the UK and your own country. However, it is recommended that you keep the bank statement ready in UKVI-approved format in case they ask.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, if your government and any international scholarship agency support you, you need to submit written consent from them.
