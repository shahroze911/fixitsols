We got the reviews of many students studying in the top universities to find out why they chose malaysia.

You can get high-quality education comparable to the UK and Australia&#8217;s universities with a cost-effective fee structure. Besides, living in Malaysia is affordable. You can easily afford to make a living, from travel expenses to living. Additionally, you can get a single room with a bathroom for a month for RM500. Moreover, the cost becomes lower if you prefer to share your accommodation.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\n\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Other than living expenses, the food quality and prices are also affordable. If you can&#8217;t cook or don&#8217;t have a cooking facility in your dorm, you can also eat from good restaurants. Furthermore, public transportation is less expensive, and you can move around quickly.<\/p>\n<p>\n\n\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\n\n<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" style=\"font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-transform: capitalize;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Universal_Language\"><\/span>2. <strong>Universal Language<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>\n\n\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\n\n<\/p>\n<p>The official language of Malaysia is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/topic\/Indonesian-language\">Bahasa<\/a> Malaysia. However, English is primarily spoken there. Moreover, there are many other languages, such as Mandarin and Tamil. So, you can easily communicate with the locals there. Speaking BM is a plus point, but you can easily survive if you can communicate in English. Therefore, you won&#8217;t have to worry about communication with locals.<\/p>\n<p>\n\n\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\n\n<\/p>\n<p><strong>But how language is the reason to study in Malaysia?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\n\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\n\n<\/p>\n<p>There are many Malaysian universities that offer degree programs in English. Not only this, but these universities also provide English language courses to enhance your grip on writing and speaking English.<\/p>\n<p>\n\n\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\n\n<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" style=\"font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Diverse_Culture\"><\/span><strong>3.

Moreover, you can see over 18 percent of people practicing Buddhism, 9 percent Christianity, and 6 percent Hinduism. Therefore, you will come across different cultural prospects. A country with multiple religions means you will experience a number of festivals throughout the year.
