For example, the cost of social sciences subjects is lower than that of medical and engineering degrees. Thus, the fee structure depends upon the level of education and the place where you are studying. Here are some free estimates for undergraduate and postgraduate:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-undergraduate\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Undergraduate\"><\/span><strong>Undergraduate<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The undergraduate tuition fee for international students, such as those from Pakistan, can range from \u00a311000 to \u00a338,000.

Thus, they can easily afford their living expenses in the UK. Moreover, some universities may also offer on-campus work placements. Some of them also have attached companies that offer jobs. So, it depends upon the student&#8217;s capabilities and how much he\/she can earn. Generally, students earn up to \u00a31200 to \u00a31500 per month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-graduate-visa\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Graduate_VISA\"><\/span><strong>Graduate VISA<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>International students can stay in the UK even after completing their degree on a post-study work visa. They can remain in the UK for two years and work there. However, you need to apply for this visa while living in the university before clearing out. The visa application fee is \u00a3822, and you might need to pay an <a href=\"https:\/\/educrestmigration.com\/study-abroad\/what-is-immigration-health-surcharge-ihs-and-its-cost\/\">immigration health surcharge<\/a> (IHS Fee) of \u00a3624 for each subsequent year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For other UK Study Visa Requirements and Costs, you Can Explore:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/educrestmigration.com\/study-abroad\/uk-study-visa-from-pakistan-price-requirements-and-process\/\">UK Study Visa from Pakistan \u2013 Price, Requirements, and Process<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-currency\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Currency\"><\/span><strong>Currency<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To manage living expenses in the UK, you need cash in your bank account and hand.
