<p>If you want to <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-in-uk/">study in the UK</a> and are concerned about living expenses in the UK, this article is for you. Aligning your budget according to the expenses is crucial to living healthy and happy in the United Kingdom. However, to align, you need to know your requirements. Keep in mind that the living costs can differ depending on the areas of the UK you are going to live in. For example, living in the UK might cost more than living in other areas. Here’s the breakdown of the cost of living in the UK.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-living-expenses-in-the-uk-for-international-students"><strong>Living Expenses in the UK</strong> <strong>for International Students</strong></h2>



<p>There are many websites available where you can count your monthly living expenses in the UK for students. However, here’s where you can find overall expenses and the average budget spent. For more details, you can refer to Expatistan.</p>



<p><strong>Living Cost in London for International Students: </strong>Make sure you have a budget of £1300 &#8211; £1400 per month if you live in London. (excluding the cost of study)</p>



<p><strong>Living Expenses in the UK for Students Outside London: </strong>Expect to spend at least £1,015 &#8211; £1300 per month for living outside London. (excluding the cost of study)</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cost-of-living-support-in-the-uk"><strong>Cost of Living Support in the UK</strong></h3>



<p>The cost of living in the UK is 250% higher than in Pakistan. And rent is 1000% more than in Pakistan. However, you can easily afford the living costs by working part-time. If you don’t have to pay rent and are single, then you can expect monthly costs up to £1,432 (PKR 521,482). However, the living costs for a family of 2 persons are £2,305 (PKR 839,398). Here’s the comprehensive overview:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> All the costs mentioned above are approximate and not the exact amount. The actual expense may vary; however, it&#8217;s best to have the spending amount according to the above details.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-does-study-cost-in-the-uk"><strong>How Much Does Study Cost in the UK?</strong></h3>



<p>The expenses to study in the UK depend upon the course, university, and campus you choose. For example, the cost of social sciences subjects is lower than that of medical and engineering degrees. Thus, the fee structure depends upon the level of education and the place where you are studying. Here are some free estimates for undergraduate and postgraduate:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-undergraduate"><strong>Undergraduate</strong></h4>



<p>The undergraduate tuition fee for international students, such as those from Pakistan, can range from £11000 to £38,000. Usually, the undergraduate degrees are three years long; however, they can vary in some regions, such as Scotland.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-postgraduate"><strong>Postgraduate</strong></h4>



<p>The postgraduate tuition fee for international students can range from £9000 to £30,000. In the UK, you can complete your master’s degree in one year and get a 2-year post-study work visa.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-students-work-in-the-uk-on-a-student-visa"><strong>Can Students Work in the UK on a Student Visa?</strong></h3>



<p>International students are allowed to work 20 hours per week during term time and full-time during holidays. Thus, they can easily afford their living expenses in the UK. Moreover, some universities may also offer on-campus work placements. Some of them also have attached companies that offer jobs. So, it depends upon the student&#8217;s capabilities and how much he/she can earn. Generally, students earn up to £1200 to £1500 per month.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-graduate-visa"><strong>Graduate VISA</strong></h3>



<p>International students can stay in the UK even after completing their degree on a post-study work visa. They can remain in the UK for two years and work there. However, you need to apply for this visa while living in the university before clearing out. The visa application fee is £822, and you might need to pay an <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-abroad/what-is-immigration-health-surcharge-ihs-and-its-cost/">immigration health surcharge</a> (IHS Fee) of £624 for each subsequent year.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-currency"><strong>Currency</strong></h3>



<p>To manage living expenses in the UK, you need cash in your bank account and hand. In the UK, you must make transactions and pay bills in pounds and pence. Besides, you can pay in coins, notes, or debits and credits while purchasing at stores. And one major thing you need to consider is the note difference. The currency notes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland">Scottish states</a> are different, although the currency is the same. However, you can use them in the UK as well. You can exchange those notes with the UK currency through any major UK bank in case of problems.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bank-accounts"><strong>Bank Accounts</strong></h3>



<p>You can open a student or temporary bank account while living in the UK. To open a bank account in the UK, you need to fulfil the following requirements:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Valid Passport.</li>



<li>Document from the university confirming that you are currently studying there.</li>



<li>Proof of address in Pakistan and UK</li>



<li>Bank statement from Pakistan (your personal bank account)</li>
</ul>



<p>You can contact your home country&#8217;s bank account to make the process easier. They might have a partnership or link with a UK-based bank. This way, you can easily create a bank account in the UK. To access the money in your UK bank account, you can:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Use online banking systems such as mobile applications</li>



<li>Visit the relevant branch of the bank</li>



<li>Withdraw money using an ATM</li>



<li>Ask for cash-back while making purchases through your card</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tips-to-save-money-for-pakistan-students-in-the-uk"><strong>Tips to Save Money for Pakistan Students in the UK</strong></h3>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>&#8211; Keep a track record of your spending and cut down unnecessary expenditures.</li>
