<p>Studying in the UK is a great opportunity; however, it’s not easy for everyone. The fee structure is expensive compared to Pakistani universities, and high living costs are another hurdle. Therefore, most students search for scholarships to manage their expenses and tuition fees. However, UK scholarships for Pakistani students, specifically fully funded, are not easy to grab. However, many other scholarships can help students manage their tuition costs.</p>



<p>If you are seeking fully funded scholarships for Pakistani students in the UK, then remember that you must be exceptional in academic history. Nonetheless, let’s skip the chit-chat and explore some of the best scholarships for students who want to study abroad. Let’s learn their criteria and requirements in detail.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-popular-uk-scholarships-for-pakistani-students"><strong>Popular UK Scholarships for Pakistani Students</strong></h2>



<p>EduCrest Migration helps undergraduate and postgraduate students from Pakistan to earn scholarships and benefits for studying in the UK. With a list of hundreds of universities offering scholarships for Pakistani students, we help you study abroad without worrying about tuition expenses. We use our online resources and university partnership opportunities to provide scholarships for all deserving students. Here’s a list of some popular scholarships for Pakistani students:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-great-scholarships"><strong>Great Scholarships</strong></h3>



<p>An excellent scholarship can be beneficial if you have an undergraduate degree and want to continue your education in the UK. You can earn up to a £10,000 scholarship on tuition fees for a one-year-taught post-graduate program. The UK government’s GREAT Britain Campaign funds this scholarship with partner UK universities.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-participating-uk-universities"><strong>Participating UK Universities</strong></h4>

<p>Another scholarship is offered by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office. This scholarship covers the full, fully funded UK scholarship for Pakistani students and the full tuition fee. Moreover, it also offers a monthly living allowance and return airfare of economy class. Besides, it also provides the cost of one visa application and a travel grant to participate in Chevening events in the UK. The student must show leadership qualities, an impressive academic background, experience, and a positive attitude.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-common-wealth-scholarship-and-fellowship-plan"><strong>Common Wealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan</strong></h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>To be admitted to universities abroad, you must apply with a statement of purpose (SOP). The SOP clarifies your goals and career paths, based on which the university representatives determine your profile. The personal statement is crucial for conveying your motivation for studying abroad, as well as your past education and future aims. Thus, you must carefully write by showing off your writing skills and suitability for the particular program.</p>



<p>Though it seems hectic, the task is easy if you follow the proper guidelines and structure covered in this article. So, how to write a statement of purpose? Let&#8217;s learn the basics and essential tips to make your SOP stand out.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-a-statement-of-purpose-sop"><strong>What is a Statement of Purpose (SOP)?</strong></h2>



<p>A Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a document that tells the admission team of a particular university abroad about your intent. It&#8217;s a personal statement that includes your past experiences, educational background, interests, and motivation to study abroad. It also includes your professional contributions and future career goals. Admission officers judge beyond your CGPA and grades by learning your intuition about joining a particular program.</p>



<p>You can also consider it an essay with a particular format that tells about your past, present, and future career prospects. Universities require different types of formats; some prefer it as an essay, while others might use question-based. This is an important element of your study abroad university application that will determine your admission success.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-is-statement-of-purpose-important"><strong>Why is Statement of Purpose Important?</strong></h2>



<p>An SOP is a stepping stone to admission to a university abroad, whether in the UK, France, or other European countries. It helps the admission offices know about your study aspirations, experience, and subject proficiency. Besides, they also look at your life&#8217;s perspective and values. In short, a well-written statement of purpose highlights your academic persona. It acts as a supporting hand to advocate for your selection and what makes you better than other applicants. Even if your academic profile is weak, an impressive SOP can add worth to it by giving the committee a subjective view.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-should-we-include-in-the-statement-of-purpose"><strong>What Should We Include in the Statement of Purpose?</strong></h2>



<p>You need to pay attention while writing SOP and keep in mind the following essential components:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Academic background and details</li>



<li>Personal and financial background</li>



<li>Professional experience (full-time/part-time job)</li>



<li>Short-term and long-term goals</li>



<li>Reasons for selecting the university</li>



<li>Reason for the selection of a particular course</li>



<li>Hobbies and interests</li>



<li>Portfolio and co-curricular activities</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-write-a-compelling-statement-of-purpose-sop"><strong>How to Write a Compelling Statement of Purpose (SOP)?</strong></h2>



<p>To write a compelling statement of purpose, you must self-reflect and think professionally. A persuasive tone and hook can help capture the reader&#8217;s attention. Moreover, you can also share your professional experiences and your future goals. Make sure to deliver a positive aspect and straightforward narrative throughout your SOP. Use simple language to focus on precision and content delivery with clarity.</p>



<p>After finishing the draft, you can get feedback from expert education consultants at EduCrest Migration. Don&#8217;t worry if you can&#8217;t draft it yourself; our experts have your back. Here are some key steps to write an SOP for studying abroad:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Do Pre-planning</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Take time and do some pre-planning. Think about what urged you to choose the specific course. Create categories and list your past experiences, achievements, and inspirations. Organize your motivations for choosing the particular country and university.</p>



<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Start Drafting</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>After gathering your data, it&#8217;s time to start writing. Share about your past experiences and academic history. Moreover, I prefer an active voice, and there is no need to use technical and complex terms. Don&#8217;t be overly efficient, and address your profile from gap years to challenges in a positive way. Besides, maintain a proper flow from the introduction to the body structure and conclusion.</p>



<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Review and Submit</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>After writing the SOP, review it for vocabulary, structure, and grammar. If you are still unsure, get opinions from seniors, experts, and EduCrest professionals. Ensure grammar and factual checks are performed before the final submission.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tips-to-write-a-statement-of-purpose-for-international-education"><strong>Tips to Write a Statement of Purpose for International Education</strong></h2>



<p>A statement of purpose holds a significant role in your application by conveying your profile. Therefore, knowing what to deliver is essential. You should know how to deliver them accurately from format to structure and content. Here are some tips to write the statement more effectively:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-format-and-structure"><strong>Format and Structure</strong></h3>



<p>It&#8217;s best to create a format before writing the statement of purpose. Use a classic format for the whole document. Use fonts like Times New Roman, size 12, and keep a line spacing of 1.5. Justify the margins in all the documents. Besides, ensure consistency in the document&#8217;s font, margins, and line spacing. It shows that you are an organized person.</p>



<p>For structure, you can follow the essay format, starting with an introduction, then the body, and concluding with a conclusion. Make sure the SOP is concise and short with proper headings. It&#8217;s best to complete it in one page or a maximum of one and a half. Avoid making it lengthy, as the admission committees will definitely ignore it.</p>



<p>Similarly, keep the content length to 400 words per page, not more. Use short sentences and paragraphs to highlight the key information.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-content-for-sop"><strong>Content for SOP</strong></h3>



<p>While the structure is essential, the content of the statement of purpose makes it attractive. It tells a story about you and is crucial in the impression of the admission officers. Here are some factors you need to consider while writing content:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-not-copy-amp-paste"><strong>Do Not Copy &amp; Paste</strong></h4>



<p>I prefer not to copy the online samples available for writing an SOP. Thousands of students around the world are doing the same. They usually start their SOP with sentences like &#8220;I am taking admission to this university because I like&#8221; or &#8220;I want to express interest in the course.&#8221; Although it&#8217;s a good approach to reach out to online sources, copying them won&#8217;t benefit you.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-think-out-of-ordinary"><strong>Think Out of Ordinary</strong></h4>



<p>Rather than starting with general sentences, try to start with something natural. You can start with the factor that encouraged you to apply to study abroad. Or you can share a story and inspiration for seeking the opportunity to study at a particular university. Note that the first impression is the last; your starting sentences will cast that first impression. So, make sure to be natural and give a hook that helps you catch admission officers&#8217; attention. Here are the examples of some terms:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The pursuit of knowledge knows no boundaries; for me, studying at…</li>



<li>Curiosity has always been my best teacher, leading me to explore (course of study) and pursue higher education at&#8230;</li>



<li>Gaining a global prospect is essential for a field like (your field of study) and your…</li>



<li>A strong foundation in (course of study) with passion and innovation is the reason for my ambition to study at…</li>



<li>Education is more than just doing assignments and giving exams; it&#8217;s about experiencing…</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-don-t-replicate-your-sop"><strong>Don&#8217;t Replicate Your SOP</strong></h4>



<p>When applying to multiple universities, you don&#8217;t need to create a whole new statement of purpose. You don&#8217;t have to write it repeatedly with different details and stories. However, it&#8217;s important not to copy your SOP entirely. Remember the university prospect, requirements for admission, and the course you are applying to. Do minor changes accordingly and then submit the SOP to other universities.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-avoid-generic-terms"><strong>Avoid Generic Terms</strong></h4>



<p>Avoid general terms such as &#8220;I have always dreamt of studying abroad, and your university is best.&#8221; Instead, use the university name and its particular courses. Showcase your research about university rankings and reviews. It&#8217;s best to tell them you have thoroughly researched and chosen their university over other options because it best suits your passion for education. Besides, also demonstrate your reviews on the course you will study and its current value and future worth.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-add-interests-and-experiences"><strong>Add Interests and Experiences</strong></h4>



<p>Your second paragraph after the introduction should list your interests and the reason behind specific course selection. After gaining initial interest in the intro paragraph, give a detailed overview of this paragraph with proper reasons.</p>



<p>In the third paragraph, show off your experiences in the field you are applying for. Mention some major milestones you have hit and your analysis of the subject you want to study. Besides, you can also highlight some experiences from working part-time or full-time in the field that are relevant to your topic.</p>



<p>You can also merge the second and third paragraphs if the content is too lengthy. This means linking the reason for studying a particular course and past accomplishments is acceptable. It&#8217;s important to discuss your success and achievements without boasting.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-write-future-aspirations"><strong>Write Future Aspirations</strong></h4>



<p>List your plans and what you want to do after studying the specific course. Avoid blabbering, like you want to work in a company, etc. Instead, try to give a comprehensive overview, such as what you will achieve while studying the course and how it will help you with your career. Also, add that course&#8217;s future scope and how it impacts one&#8217;s career success. Balance your strengths and inspirations by showing modesty.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mention-co-curricular-activities"><strong>Mention Co-Curricular Activities</strong></h4>



<p>If you still have some space in the document, list your interests and extracurricular activities. However, it&#8217;s best to add the skills relevant to your career inspirations. For example, playing a guitar can be good if you want to become an instructor, but it&#8217;s irrelevant to your goal of becoming a cybersecurity specialist.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-use-past-present-amp-future"><strong>The Use Past, Present, &amp; Future</strong></h4>



<p>Use the past, present, and future tenses to structure your statement of purpose for study abroad. You can start with your previous experiences and then explain what you are doing now. Moreover, you can also explain what makes you the best fit for the program. Lastly, go for the future benefits you will yield by studying that particular course.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-writing-style"><strong>Writing Style</strong></h3>



<p>Writing style is also essential when crafting a statement of purpose. You must show off your writing skills in only 400 to 500 words and persuade the admission officers that you are the right fit. Don&#8217;t be too friendly and use a conversational tone because the ones you presented before are admission committee members. However, you don&#8217;t need to be too formal, as it won&#8217;t show your genuine interest in studying there. So, it&#8217;s best to maintain a balance between them. Use personal style and avoid using AI, as it makes the content sound robotic.</p>



<p>Subsequently, emphasize giving a clear, concise, and strong statement. Express confidence in your words and convey your eagerness to get accepted into a particular overseas university. Moreover, keep a positive approach.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-proofreading"><strong>Proofreading</strong></h3>



<p>Lastly, check for spelling mistakes and grammar issues. You can use Grammarly, a software that highlights grammar mistakes. Applying for a course to study abroad requires a specific level of English proficiency. Therefore, make sure to deliver your English skills and knowledge correctly.</p>



<p>After the draft is complete, keep it as it is for a few times. Think, return, and edit the details as per the requirements. Writing the whole statement of purpose in one go can be tiring, and you may skip some crucial details. Thus, it&#8217;s best to take time and revise it after a few days.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-make-impression-with-a-persuasive-sop"><strong>Make Impression with a Persuasive SOP</strong></h2>



<p>A Statement of Purpose allows you to highlight your academic profile, interests, and future goals. With the details about your background and inspirations, the admission committee understands what makes you ideal for the course you are applying for. Follow the above details closely while writing an SOP to study abroad or for graduate school.</p>

<p>If you want to <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-in-uk/">study in the UK</a> and are concerned about living expenses in the UK, this article is for you. Aligning your budget according to the expenses is crucial to living healthy and happy in the United Kingdom. However, to align, you need to know your requirements. Keep in mind that the living costs can differ depending on the areas of the UK you are going to live in. For example, living in the UK might cost more than living in other areas. Here’s the breakdown of the cost of living in the UK.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-living-expenses-in-the-uk-for-international-students"><strong>Living Expenses in the UK</strong> <strong>for International Students</strong></h2>



<p>There are many websites available where you can count your monthly living expenses in the UK for students. However, here’s where you can find overall expenses and the average budget spent. For more details, you can refer to Expatistan.</p>



<p><strong>Living Cost in London for International Students: </strong>Make sure you have a budget of £1300 &#8211; £1400 per month if you live in London. (excluding the cost of study)</p>



<p><strong>Living Expenses in the UK for Students Outside London: </strong>Expect to spend at least £1,015 &#8211; £1300 per month for living outside London. (excluding the cost of study)</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cost-of-living-support-in-the-uk"><strong>Cost of Living Support in the UK</strong></h3>



<p>The cost of living in the UK is 250% higher than in Pakistan. And rent is 1000% more than in Pakistan. However, you can easily afford the living costs by working part-time.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> All the costs mentioned above are approximate and not the exact amount. The actual expense may vary; however, it&#8217;s best to have the spending amount according to the above details.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-does-study-cost-in-the-uk"><strong>How Much Does Study Cost in the UK?</strong></h3>



<p>The expenses to study in the UK depend upon the course, university, and campus you choose. For example, the cost of social sciences subjects is lower than that of medical and engineering degrees. Thus, the fee structure depends upon the level of education and the place where you are studying. Here are some free estimates for undergraduate and postgraduate:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-undergraduate"><strong>Undergraduate</strong></h4>



<p>The undergraduate tuition fee for international students, such as those from Pakistan, can range from £11000 to £38,000. Usually, the undergraduate degrees are three years long; however, they can vary in some regions, such as Scotland.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-postgraduate"><strong>Postgraduate</strong></h4>



<p>The postgraduate tuition fee for international students can range from £9000 to £30,000. In the UK, you can complete your master’s degree in one year and get a 2-year post-study work visa.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-students-work-in-the-uk-on-a-student-visa"><strong>Can Students Work in the UK on a Student Visa?</strong></h3>



<p>International students are allowed to work 20 hours per week during term time and full-time during holidays. Thus, they can easily afford their living expenses in the UK. Moreover, some universities may also offer on-campus work placements. Some of them also have attached companies that offer jobs. So, it depends upon the student&#8217;s capabilities and how much he/she can earn. Generally, students earn up to £1200 to £1500 per month.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-graduate-visa"><strong>Graduate VISA</strong></h3>



<p>International students can stay in the UK even after completing their degree on a post-study work visa. They can remain in the UK for two years and work there. However, you need to apply for this visa while living in the university before clearing out. The visa application fee is £822, and you might need to pay an <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-abroad/what-is-immigration-health-surcharge-ihs-and-its-cost/">immigration health surcharge</a> (IHS Fee) of £624 for each subsequent year.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-currency"><strong>Currency</strong></h3>



<p>To manage living expenses in the UK, you need cash in your bank account and hand. In the UK, you must make transactions and pay bills in pounds and pence. Besides, you can pay in coins, notes, or debits and credits while purchasing at stores. And one major thing you need to consider is the note difference. The currency notes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland">Scottish states</a> are different, although the currency is the same. However, you can use them in the UK as well. You can exchange those notes with the UK currency through any major UK bank in case of problems.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bank-accounts"><strong>Bank Accounts</strong></h3>



<p>You can open a student or temporary bank account while living in the UK. To open a bank account in the UK, you need to fulfil the following requirements:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Valid Passport.</li>



<li>Document from the university confirming that you are currently studying there.</li>



<li>Proof of address in Pakistan and UK</li>



<li>Bank statement from Pakistan (your personal bank account)</li>
</ul>



<p>You can contact your home country&#8217;s bank account to make the process easier. They might have a partnership or link with a UK-based bank. This way, you can easily create a bank account in the UK. To access the money in your UK bank account, you can:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Use online banking systems such as mobile applications</li>



<li>Visit the relevant branch of the bank</li>



<li>Withdraw money using an ATM</li>



<li>Ask for cash-back while making purchases through your card</li>

<ul class="wp-block-list">

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) is a fee that most people pay with their UK VISA application. The IHS fee differs from all other fees you pay during your Visa application process. It usually costs £1,035 for the principal applicant and £776 for students and children <strong>from 6th February 2024</strong> according to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/healthcare-immigration-application">UK Government</a>. The IHS cost is the same for adult dependents as the primary visa application. Besides, the amount of IHS depends upon the period you are applying for. You won&#8217;t get a Visa if you haven&#8217;t paid the immigration health surcharge. If the wrong amount is paid being paid, the embassy can delay your UK Visa.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the process of the Immigration Health Surcharge?</strong></h2>



<p>If you pay the immigration health surcharge or are exempt from paying it, you can take national health services in the UK. In short, if you have a visa of more than six months, IHS is a must, and you will get the treatment from an NHS hospital like an ordinary resident of England. However, certain services, such as prescriptions, dental treatment, and eye treatment, won&#8217;t be free won&#8217;t be free. But, if your Visa ends earlier than planned, you will be charged for any <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/">NHS</a> hospital treatment from the time your Visa ends. Besides, if you renew your Visa, you will still pay the charges for any treatment you get after the end of your previous Visa.</p>



<p>Moreover, if you apply for an extension of your Visa, you must pay the IHS further. Similarly, you won&#8217;t have to pay the surcharge if you apply for leave to remain. Consequently, paying the immigration health surcharge does not mean you will get the treatment faster, but it means you can avail of all the services provided by NHS. Doctors will treat you the same way as ordinary residents, and you will be treated according to the urgency of your condition.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>Why Do You Have to Pay the IHS for a VISA?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>If you are not from the UK, such as a Pakistani student or worker trying to apply for a UK Visa, you must pay IHS first. If your period of stay in the UK is more than 6 months, paying IHS is a must. However, if you are applying for a permanent stay in the UK, then the case is different. Besides, if you are applying for entry clearance of 6 months or less, you must have private health insurance with you.</p>



<p>If you are applying from within the UK, paying for an immigration health surcharge is a must in case of a Visa extension, even if it&#8217;s for less than 6 months.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>Immigration Health Surcharge Exemption</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>You can use the National Health Services without paying the immigration health surcharge if:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Applicants for health and care visas, including their dependents, are exempt from IHS. They will not have to pay the IHS fee during their visa filing.</li>



<li>If you are applying for infinite leave to enter and exit from England.</li>



<li>If you will settle down in the UK or apply for permanent immigration.</li>



<li>If you are a member of UK visiting delegates, armed forces, and a diplomat.</li>



<li>If you are a member of the Armed forces of other countries that do not lie under immigration control.</li>



<li>If you are seeking asylum or a domestic worker such as a victim of slavery.</li>
</ol>



<p>There are many others, such as S2 healthcare visitors, frontier work permits, etc. However, as we are dealing with UK Visas for students, you must pay the IHS fee for a UK visa.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>IHS Fee for UK VISA- How Much to Pay?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>The amount of your IHS fee depends upon the period of your visa application. The Visa can last longer than your study duration and employment period. The charge is <strong>£776 per year for students for stays lasting 6–12 months</strong> and <strong>£388 for additional periods of less than 6 months</strong>. <strong>£776 </strong>for visa and immigration applications under 18.</p>



<p><strong>£1,035 </strong>per year for all other visa applications. Moreover, all other applicants must pay <strong>£517.50 </strong>for additional periods of less than 6 months. If you are applying for over 6 months but less than a year, you must pay the full-year IHS Visa Fee.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size"><strong>Example 1:</strong></h4>



<p></p>



<p>If you are enrolling in a 12-month course, your Visa will typically start one month before the course begins and extend to cover the course duration plus an additional four months. This makes your Visa valid for 17 months, requiring you to pay an IHS fee of <strong>£1,164 (£776 + £388)</strong>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size"><strong>Example 2:</strong></h4>



<p></p>



<p>For a three-year undergraduate degree program, the IHS fee is <strong>£776 per year</strong> of your course, plus <strong>£388</strong> for the additional time included in your Visa before and after your course. This totals <strong>£2,716</strong> over three years.</p>



<p>The IHS ensures access to healthcare services throughout your stay in the UK. Be sure to include this cost in your budgeting plans.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size"><strong>Dependents Cost for Immigration Health Surcharge</strong></h4>



<p></p>



<p>Those who are older than 18 will have to pay the same IHS fee as yours. The exact amount of IHS depends upon the period of the Visa you are applying for.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>What Happens if You Do Not Pay IHS?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>If you do not pay an immigration health surcharge fee for UK Visas, you will get an email. It will give you the guidelines on how to pay IHS. The email address will be the same as you put in for the visa application. After receiving the email, you must pay the surcharge within 10 working days if you are in the UK and within seven working days if you are from another country like Pakistan. If the IHS fee is not submitted within the given timespan, your visa application will be turned down immediately.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>How to Pay the Immigration Health Surcharge from Pakistan?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>You need to pay the immigration health surcharge on the date of submission of your visa application. Usually, it comes within the online application form for most visas. As a result, it is impossible to file for a visa without paying the IHS fee. You may need to give the start and end details from the certificate of sponsorship. Or you may need to add the course dates if you are applying for a student visa. After finalizing your application form, you will see a page to pay IHS.</p>



<p>After paying that, you will receive an email with the IHS reference number. You can only use this number once; if you are applying again for VISA, you may need to pay IHS again to get this reference number. After that, you will be returned to the form to make the application fee next. You need a credit or debit card for this. Note that you can&#8217;t apply with cash and bank transfers unless you are a resident of North Korea.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>What&#8217;s the Procedure for an IHS Fee Refund?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>You will get the full IHS fee refund in case:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Suppose you have paid the IHS fee twice or more for the same Visa. The extra amount will be refunded after the Visa is granted.</li>



<li>If you get a visa refusal or withdraw your visa application before its decision, you will get a refund.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>You will get the partial IHS fee refund if your visa application is submitted, but:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You got a shorter visa than you filed for. For example, you asked for two years and got a Visa for one and a half years.</li>



<li>If any dependents are refused a visa, they will get their IHS fee back.</li>



<li>You are applying for a UK Visa again and have already paid the IHS for that period.</li>
</ul>



<p>Moreover, if you have paid the IHS fee twice for the same period of 6 or more than 6 months, the partial refund amount will be rounded to the nearest 6 months. For example, if you paid for 20 months, the refund will be 18 months of IHS. Paying twice for less than 6 months of IHS is not entitled to any refund.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>How Will I Get the Refund, and How long will it Take?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>You don&#8217;t need to take any action if you are entitled to a partial or full IHS refund. The amount will be returned to the account you paid the IHS Fee with. You will usually get the refund within 28 days. However, if you appeal the visa application refusal and ask for a review, the refund can take longer. If your appeal is successful, you will have to pay the IHS again in case it&#8217;s refunded.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>In What Case Do You Won&#8217;t Get a Refund?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>You won&#8217;t get any refund if you</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Withdraw your visa application but have already received the Visa.</li>



<li>You got your VISA but decided not to go to the UK.</li>



<li>You left the UK before the ending period mentioned in the Visa.</li>



<li>You are asked to leave the UK for any reason or mishap.</li>



<li>You are switching to another Visa type or applying for indefinite leave to remain.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>When Can You Start Using NHS with Immigration Health Surcharge? </strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>You can start using the NHS free of cost from the starting date of your Visa. However, IHS payment is a must. If you are in the UK and the Home Office hasn&#8217;t decided on your VISA approval, you might need to pay for NHS. Moreover, you might need to pay for services like prescriptions, dental treatment, and eye care. Besides, to access NHS, you may need to show the BRP (biometric residence permit) or a share code in case of digital immigration status.</p>
