<p><strong>Are you going to apply for a UK Study Visa from Pakistan? Here&#8217;s your complete guide for price, requirements, documentation, and process.</strong></p>

The UK is the perfect study destination for Pakistani students and offers you diverse career opportunities. No doubt why our ancestors and founders choose to go to the UK for higher education. You can study, live, work, and pursue your dreams in the UK effortlessly. However, living in the present is best before dreaming of the UK&#8217;s exceptional education and work opportunities. To study in the UK, you need to apply and get admission to a university, and the most crucial step is securing a UK student visa from Pakistan. What&#8217;s your take on the study visa fee, process, and requirements? Let&#8217;s explore!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Types of UK Study Visa from Pakistan</strong></h2>



<p>&nbsp;There are three types of UK student visas from Pakistan. Here&#8217;s the detail:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>General Study Visa (Tier 4)</strong></h3>



<p>For those who are above 16 and have secured admission to a UK educational institution. Besides, the student should have enough money to support his fees and living expenses. Moreover, they can speak and understand English (English language test (IELTS, PTE, Duolingo, etc.).</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When should you apply for a UK study visa?</strong></h4>



<p>The best time to apply for a UK study visa from Pakistan is 3 months before the start of your course at a UK university. You will usually get visa approval or rejection within 3 weeks. So, it&#8217;s best to apply ahead.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What&#8217;s the best time to arrive in the UK?</strong></h4>



<p>The best time to arrive in the UK for a short course, such as 6 months or less, is a week in advance. However, if your course is longer than 6 months, you should arrive up to 30 days before commencing your classes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Child Study Visa</strong></h3>



<p>Students aged less than 16 and more than 4 need a sponsor to study in the UK. You must have consent from your parents if you are 16 or 17, and you may need to provide written evidence.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When should you apply for a UK study visa?</strong></h4>



<p>The best time to apply for a UK study visa from Pakistan is 3 months before classes start.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What&#8217;s the best time to arrive in the UK?</strong></h4>



<p>Suppose the course for child students is less than six months; it&#8217;s best to arrive in the UK one week before the course starts. And if the course is longer than 6 months, it&#8217;s best to arrive up to one month in advance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Short-term Study Visa</strong></h3>



<p>Short-term study visa students usually go there for a language course or a training program. You should also apply for this visa 3 months before the start of the course of the program. Moreover, the best time to arrive in the UK depends upon your travel dates.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>UK Study Visa Requirements from Pakistan</strong></h2>



<p>For a UK Study Visa, you need to meet several requirements. You must have a CAS letter from a UK university. Financial evidence, including your course fee and living expenses, is also necessary. Besides that, you should have proof of English language proficiency to speak, read, and understand English. Here&#8217;s the detail of each step and requirement for a UK study visa:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Select Your Course and University</strong></h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list"></ol>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list"></ol>



<p>&nbsp;The first step to securing a UK study visa from Pakistan is to find the right course and university. Is it overwhelming, right? That&#8217;s not a big deal if you have the best education consultants at your back. Apply for the universities and get an unconditional offer letter from a UK university approved by the UK government. Here are the steps you need to follow:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Contact EduCrest Migration to select the right course and university for upcoming intakes.</li>



<li>We will assign you to our expert UK study consultants, who will guide you through the courses, universities, fee structures, and ranking.</li>



<li>The next step is applying to those universities; we will need little documentation, such as certificates and degrees, CNIC, SOP, and others, to submit the applications to universities.</li>



<li>It&#8217;s best to complete all the requirements, such as CGPA, <a href="https://ielts.org/">IELTS</a> or other English proficiency tests, to get an unconditional offer letter. If you receive a conditional offer letter, you need to meet the university&#8217;s conditions to have an unconditional offer.</li>



<li>After the offer letter, you may be asked to submit the initial deposit and do a university interview. It&#8217;s not a big deal, as our <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/">best education consultants in Islamabad</a>, Pakistan will guide you through everything.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Get a Confirmation of Acceptance (CAS)</strong></h3>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list"></ol>



<p>The next step is to get the CAS letter from the university. After receiving the unconditional offer letter, you need to share a few more documents with your university. After their submission, the university will issue a CAS letter, and then you can apply for a UK study visa from Pakistan. Here&#8217;s what you need to share with your university:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Initial deposit receipt (usually 4000 GBP; the more you submit, the more chances you have for CAS and VISA).</li>



<li>TB test report from UKVI-approved TB test centres in Pakistan.</li>



<li>Bank statement of 28 days (no less than 31 days old). Must use <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-abroad/list-of-ukvi-approved-banks-in-pakistan-to-study-in-uk/">UKVI-approved banks for UK study</a> bank statements.</li>



<li>If your parents are supporting your expenses to study in the UK, you need to submit an Affidavit of support.</li>



<li>A birth certificate or B-form is required to prove your relationship with the sponsor.</li>
</ol>



<p>After these steps, the university will assess all the above documents and issue you a CAS (Confirmation of Acceptance of Studies). This document is a must for your UK student visa from Pakistan. This letter is proof of your admission to a UK university, showing a unique reference number and university details.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Financial Requirements for UK Student Visa</strong></h3>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list"></ol>



<p>You must show proof of finances to apply for a UK study visa from Pakistan. It confirms that the student has enough funds to support their course and living expenses. Here&#8217;s the detail of the <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-abroad/bank-statement-for-uk-study-visa-from-pakistan-in-2025/">bank statement for the UK student Visa</a>:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Course fee for the entire year (after paying initial deposit). Which is usually £10,000 to £40,000 per year.</li>



<li>Living costs in the UK for a maximum duration of 9 months. You must have £1,483 for each month and £13,347 in total as of 9 months if you are living in London.</li>



<li>Living outside London will cost £1,136 each month for a maximum of 9 months. You will need in total £10,224.</li>



<li>In total, you will need £27,347 for the bank statement. However, it&#8217;s not the exact amount.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Documents Required for UK Student Visa</strong></h3>



<p>Preparing all of your documents before applying for a UK student visa from Pakistan is best. The documentation usually includes:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Current Pakistani passport or valid travel document.</li>



<li>CAS letter from the university and other documentation.</li>



<li><a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-abroad/bank-statement-for-uk-study-visa-from-pakistan-in-2025/">Bank statement for UK student visa</a> from Pakistan (sponsor letters, etc.).</li>



<li>English proficiency proof (IELTS, TOEFL, PTE, Language Cert, and others) or MOI letter signed by the university.</li>



<li>A birth certificate or FRC is required to give proof of relationship sponsorship.</li>



<li>TB test results from approved UKVI TB test centre in Pakistan.</li>



<li>Academic documents such as degrees are mentioned on your CAS.</li>



<li>IHS (Immigration Health Surcharge) fee paid slip.</li>



<li>For dependents, you might need to submit extra documentation such as their passports, IHS fees, TB tests, etc.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Tuberculosis (TB) Test</strong></h3>



<p>You also need to submit a TB test as a Pakistani student to study in the UK. The TB test result should not be older than the last 6 months of its submission date. You need to get an appointment at a UKVI-approved clinic in Pakistan, take the test, and get its certificate. The <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-abroad/tuberculosis-testing-in-pakistan-for-uk-visa-guide-for-tb-test/">UKVI-approved TB test centres list</a> is already in EduCrest Migration&#8217;s blog list.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Apply for a UK Study Visa from Pakistan Online</strong></h3>



<p>After completing the documentation and the above requirements, you are ready to apply for a UK visa. You can apply for a UK visa with the help of the best UK study visa consultants in Pakistan. EduCrest Migration&#8217;s experts will help you complete all the requirements and file your visa with a 100% success ratio. However, you can also apply for a UK student visa by following these steps:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Visit the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/student-visa/apply-online">UK Visas and Immigration Website</a> (Gov.UK).</li>



<li>Sign up for the account, select your visa type, which is Tier 4 General, and fill out the application form.</li>



<li>Pay the UK student visa fee from Pakistan, which is £490 as of 2025.</li>
</ol>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>7. Pay Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS)</strong></h4>



<p>While filing your application, you will also pay the IHS fee. This fee is for NHS (National Health Services in the UK) access. The IHS Fee is £776 for a student visa application, including a stay of 6-12 months. £1,035 per year for all other visa applications. You might need to pay more for an additional stay. Learn more about <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-abroad/what-is-immigration-health-surcharge-ihs-and-its-cost/">IHS Fees and Costs</a> here!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>8. Biometric Residence Permit</strong></h3>



<p>Not that after submitting your online student visa application, you need to provide biometric verification (biometric residence permit). Just schedule an appointment at the UK visa application centre for that purpose. Provide your fingerprints and a digital photo of your face there.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>9. Supporting Documents and Interview</strong></h3>



<p>You might be asked to submit the additional supporting documents online at VAC. Get and submit them according to instructions. Moreover, you may be asked for a credibility interview (UK visa interview). In this interview, you will be asked about your study plans, course, reasons for choosing the UK, and plans. This interview checks your credibility and intentions of studying in the UK. Our education consultants help prepare you for this interview with expert guidance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>10. Wait for Visa Approval</strong></h3>



<p>After completing all the above steps, you must wait for the decision. It can take up to 3 weeks to announce the decision. You can also track your Visa application. You will receive a Visa Vignette (sticker) if your UK embassy approves your visa. This sticker means that you can travel to the UK without any restrictions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>11.</strong> <strong>Travel to the UK and Collect BRP (Biometric Residence Permit)</strong></h3>



<p>After getting your visa, just book the air ticket to travel to UK and collect your BRP there. A biometric residence permit (BRP) acts like a CNIC in the UK. It confirms your identity, study rights, and access to any public service. It includes your name, date, place of birth, face, and fingerprints. Besides, it also includes your purpose of staying in the UK.  What types of services, such as NHS, can you access and what expiry date?</p>



<p>You can collect your BRP after arriving in the UK. Collect your BRP before the vignette sticker expires or within 10 days of arrival in the UK. The decision letter includes the name of the post office branch or sponsor from which you can collect the BRP. Remember to bring your passport and travel documents to collect the BRP.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Some Major Considerations</strong></h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Start your visa application process at least three months before your course start date.</li>



<li>Make sure the information you provide is valid and latest.</li>



<li>Maintain communication with the university or relevant education consultant for any query.</li>



<li>You need keen attention to detail while filing a visa application. A single mistake or statement can affect your approval for a UK study visa from Pakistan.</li>
</ul>

<p>Are you preparing to study in the UK, and are you done with the admission process? If you have given your admission responsibility to EduCrest Migration, then understanding some significant steps involving the UK Study visa is crucial. You must follow some rules and regulations set by UKVI to get a UK study Visa. The most important aspects include student bank statements and the TB test for UK visas. In simple words, if you stay in the UK for more than 6 months, then tuberculosis testing is necessary. After that, you can set high expectations for acquiring a UK visa. </p>



<p>Let’s explore some major aspects of tuberculosis testing, the list of approved clinics by UKVI, and the procedure. We will also review the requirements, fees, and methods for TB testing. Let’s dive in.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why is Tuberculosis Testing Necessary for a UK Visa?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The UK has set the rule that anyone coming to the UK, whether for work or study purposes, for more than a period of 6 months must undergo TB testing. However, these limitations are for a few countries, and Pakistan, unfortunately, lies there. If you are a Pakistani student who wants to continue his higher education in the UK, the TB test is mandatory for you. The basic logic behind this test is promoting a healthy and safe environment. The UK is committed to offering public health protection to avoid spreading this lethal disease.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Requirements for TB Test in Pakistan for UK Visa</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>Going for a TB test is also more complicated if you undergo it for a UK Visa. You must fulfil the following requirements before going for the test:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Your CNIC (Computerized National Identity Card) for identification</li>



<li>2 copies of your passport</li>



<li>3 photographs (passport-size, on a white background)</li>



<li>Medical history (Documents, Reports, and others)</li>



<li>Medical certificates (if any)</li>



<li>Fee for TB Test (Cash/Card Payment): </li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Adults:</strong> PKR 11000/-&nbsp; to PKR 15000/-</p>



<p><strong>Children Below 11 Years of Age:</strong> PKR 9000/-</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tuberculosis Testing Clinics Approved by UKVI</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>Your test should be from the clinics approved by the Home Office UK. The UK government will not accept any test certificate which is not from the approved clinic list. Here’s the list of clinics where you can opt for TB tests in Pakistan:</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the Validity of the TB Test for a UK Visa?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>The validity for the Tuberculosis test is 6 months from the test date onwards. However, doing the TB test 3 to 4 weeks before applying for a Visa is recommended. Besides, make sure to put the following information on the TB clearance certificate:&nbsp;</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Complete name</li>



<li>X-Ray date</li>



<li>Date of birth</li>



<li>X-Ray result date</li>



<li>Full name and address of the clinic that provided the certificate. </li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s the procedure for the TB test in Pakistan?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>As a UK Visa applicant, you will undergo a chest x-ray for tuberculosis analysis. If the test has complications, you can request a sputum sample. After that, the doctor will do a tuberculin skin test (Mantoux test, MT). Besides, the procedures for children and pregnant women are a little different. Usually, children under 11 do not undergo X-rays; the clinician decides whether the child has TB or not. For pregnant women, there are many options, such as an extra shield during the x-ray, sputum test, or waiting for delivery. However, note that a sputum test will take up to 8 weeks for results and is a little costlier.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What happens if the TB test for a UK visa is positive?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>If, by any chance, the applicant has TB, they will undergo treatment. Your doctor will refer you for antibiotic treatment. After the treatment, they will be tested again at an extra cost.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What happens if I need to provide the TB test certificate with a visa application?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>Nothing happens other than visa refusal, so we hope you won’t take the risk. The government of the UK sets this TB test requirement, so providing a TB test certificate is necessary. The applicant must provide the valid certificate received from UKVI-approved clinics within six months of the TB test date.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How long do TB test results take, and what is the procedure for a UK VISA?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>You will be issued a certificate if you don’t have any TB signs and your test result is negative. If your chest X-rays show the symptoms of pulmonary TB, you will need to undergo sputum smears or other culture tests. The results can take typically from 6 to 8 weeks.&nbsp;</p>
