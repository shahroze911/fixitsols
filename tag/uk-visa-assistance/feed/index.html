<p>If you want to <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-in-uk/">study in the UK</a> and are concerned about living expenses in the UK, this article is for you. Aligning your budget according to the expenses is crucial to living healthy and happy in the United Kingdom. However, to align, you need to know your requirements. Keep in mind that the living costs can differ depending on the areas of the UK you are going to live in. For example, living in the UK might cost more than living in other areas. Here’s the breakdown of the cost of living in the UK.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-living-expenses-in-the-uk-for-international-students"><strong>Living Expenses in the UK</strong> <strong>for International Students</strong></h2>



<p>There are many websites available where you can count your monthly living expenses in the UK for students. However, here’s where you can find overall expenses and the average budget spent. For more details, you can refer to Expatistan.</p>



<p><strong>Living Cost in London for International Students: </strong>Make sure you have a budget of £1300 &#8211; £1400 per month if you live in London. (excluding the cost of study)</p>



<p><strong>Living Expenses in the UK for Students Outside London: </strong>Expect to spend at least £1,015 &#8211; £1300 per month for living outside London. (excluding the cost of study)</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cost-of-living-support-in-the-uk"><strong>Cost of Living Support in the UK</strong></h3>



<p>The cost of living in the UK is 250% higher than in Pakistan. And rent is 1000% more than in Pakistan. However, you can easily afford the living costs by working part-time. If you don’t have to pay rent and are single, then you can expect monthly costs up to £1,432 (PKR 521,482). However, the living costs for a family of 2 persons are £2,305 (PKR 839,398). Here’s the comprehensive overview:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> All the costs mentioned above are approximate and not the exact amount. The actual expense may vary; however, it&#8217;s best to have the spending amount according to the above details.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-does-study-cost-in-the-uk"><strong>How Much Does Study Cost in the UK?</strong></h3>



<p>The expenses to study in the UK depend upon the course, university, and campus you choose. For example, the cost of social sciences subjects is lower than that of medical and engineering degrees. Thus, the fee structure depends upon the level of education and the place where you are studying. Here are some free estimates for undergraduate and postgraduate:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-undergraduate"><strong>Undergraduate</strong></h4>



<p>The undergraduate tuition fee for international students, such as those from Pakistan, can range from £11000 to £38,000. Usually, the undergraduate degrees are three years long; however, they can vary in some regions, such as Scotland.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-postgraduate"><strong>Postgraduate</strong></h4>



<p>The postgraduate tuition fee for international students can range from £9000 to £30,000. In the UK, you can complete your master’s degree in one year and get a 2-year post-study work visa.</p>

<p>International students are allowed to work 20 hours per week during term time and full-time during holidays. Thus, they can easily afford their living expenses in the UK. Moreover, some universities may also offer on-campus work placements. Some of them also have attached companies that offer jobs. So, it depends upon the student&#8217;s capabilities and how much he/she can earn. Generally, students earn up to £1200 to £1500 per month.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-graduate-visa"><strong>Graduate VISA</strong></h3>



<p>International students can stay in the UK even after completing their degree on a post-study work visa. They can remain in the UK for two years and work there. However, you need to apply for this visa while living in the university before clearing out. The visa application fee is £822, and you might need to pay an <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-abroad/what-is-immigration-health-surcharge-ihs-and-its-cost/">immigration health surcharge</a> (IHS Fee) of £624 for each subsequent year.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Types of UK Study Visa from Pakistan</strong></h2>

<p>The best time to apply for a UK study visa from Pakistan is 3 months before the start of your course at a UK university. You will usually get visa approval or rejection within 3 weeks. So, it&#8217;s best to apply ahead.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What&#8217;s the best time to arrive in the UK?</strong></h4>



<p>The best time to arrive in the UK for a short course, such as 6 months or less, is a week in advance. However, if your course is longer than 6 months, you should arrive up to 30 days before commencing your classes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Child Study Visa</strong></h3>



<p>Students aged less than 16 and more than 4 need a sponsor to study in the UK. You must have consent from your parents if you are 16 or 17, and you may need to provide written evidence.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When should you apply for a UK study visa?</strong></h4>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What&#8217;s the best time to arrive in the UK?</strong></h4>



<p>Suppose the course for child students is less than six months; it&#8217;s best to arrive in the UK one week before the course starts. And if the course is longer than 6 months, it&#8217;s best to arrive up to one month in advance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Short-term Study Visa</strong></h3>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>UK Study Visa Requirements from Pakistan</strong></h2>



<p>For a UK Study Visa, you need to meet several requirements. You must have a CAS letter from a UK university. Financial evidence, including your course fee and living expenses, is also necessary. Besides that, you should have proof of English language proficiency to speak, read, and understand English. Here&#8217;s the detail of each step and requirement for a UK study visa:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Select Your Course and University</strong></h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list"></ol>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list"></ol>



<p>&nbsp;The first step to securing a UK study visa from Pakistan is to find the right course and university. Is it overwhelming, right? That&#8217;s not a big deal if you have the best education consultants at your back. Apply for the universities and get an unconditional offer letter from a UK university approved by the UK government. Here are the steps you need to follow:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Contact EduCrest Migration to select the right course and university for upcoming intakes.</li>



<li>We will assign you to our expert UK study consultants, who will guide you through the courses, universities, fee structures, and ranking.</li>



<li>The next step is applying to those universities; we will need little documentation, such as certificates and degrees, CNIC, SOP, and others, to submit the applications to universities.</li>



<li>It&#8217;s best to complete all the requirements, such as CGPA, <a href="https://ielts.org/">IELTS</a> or other English proficiency tests, to get an unconditional offer letter. If you receive a conditional offer letter, you need to meet the university&#8217;s conditions to have an unconditional offer.</li>



<li>After the offer letter, you may be asked to submit the initial deposit and do a university interview. It&#8217;s not a big deal, as our <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/">best education consultants in Islamabad</a>, Pakistan will guide you through everything.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Get a Confirmation of Acceptance (CAS)</strong></h3>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list"></ol>



<p>The next step is to get the CAS letter from the university. After receiving the unconditional offer letter, you need to share a few more documents with your university. After their submission, the university will issue a CAS letter, and then you can apply for a UK study visa from Pakistan. Here&#8217;s what you need to share with your university:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Initial deposit receipt (usually 4000 GBP; the more you submit, the more chances you have for CAS and VISA).</li>



<li>TB test report from UKVI-approved TB test centres in Pakistan.</li>



<li>Bank statement of 28 days (no less than 31 days old). Must use <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-abroad/list-of-ukvi-approved-banks-in-pakistan-to-study-in-uk/">UKVI-approved banks for UK study</a> bank statements.</li>



<li>If your parents are supporting your expenses to study in the UK, you need to submit an Affidavit of support.</li>



<li>A birth certificate or B-form is required to prove your relationship with the sponsor.</li>
</ol>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Current Pakistani passport or valid travel document.</li>



<li>CAS letter from the university and other documentation.</li>



<li><a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-abroad/bank-statement-for-uk-study-visa-from-pakistan-in-2025/">Bank statement for UK student visa</a> from Pakistan (sponsor letters, etc.).</li>

</ul>

<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Visit the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/student-visa/apply-online">UK Visas and Immigration Website</a> (Gov.UK).</li>



<li>Sign up for the account, select your visa type, which is Tier 4 General, and fill out the application form.</li>



<li>Pay the UK student visa fee from Pakistan, which is £490 as of 2025.</li>
</ol>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>7. Pay Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS)</strong></h4>



<p>While filing your application, you will also pay the IHS fee. This fee is for NHS (National Health Services in the UK) access. The IHS Fee is £776 for a student visa application, including a stay of 6-12 months. £1,035 per year for all other visa applications. You might need to pay more for an additional stay. Learn more about <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-abroad/what-is-immigration-health-surcharge-ihs-and-its-cost/">IHS Fees and Costs</a> here!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>8. Biometric Residence Permit</strong></h3>



<p>Not that after submitting your online student visa application, you need to provide biometric verification (biometric residence permit). Just schedule an appointment at the UK visa application centre for that purpose. Provide your fingerprints and a digital photo of your face there.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>9. Supporting Documents and Interview</strong></h3>



<p>You might be asked to submit the additional supporting documents online at VAC. Get and submit them according to instructions. Moreover, you may be asked for a credibility interview (UK visa interview). In this interview, you will be asked about your study plans, course, reasons for choosing the UK, and plans. This interview checks your credibility and intentions of studying in the UK. Our education consultants help prepare you for this interview with expert guidance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>10. Wait for Visa Approval</strong></h3>



<p>After completing all the above steps, you must wait for the decision. It can take up to 3 weeks to announce the decision. You can also track your Visa application. You will receive a Visa Vignette (sticker) if your UK embassy approves your visa. This sticker means that you can travel to the UK without any restrictions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>11.</strong> <strong>Travel to the UK and Collect BRP (Biometric Residence Permit)</strong></h3>



<p>After getting your visa, just book the air ticket to travel to UK and collect your BRP there. A biometric residence permit (BRP) acts like a CNIC in the UK. It confirms your identity, study rights, and access to any public service. It includes your name, date, place of birth, face, and fingerprints. Besides, it also includes your purpose of staying in the UK.  What types of services, such as NHS, can you access and what expiry date?</p>



<p>You can collect your BRP after arriving in the UK. Collect your BRP before the vignette sticker expires or within 10 days of arrival in the UK. The decision letter includes the name of the post office branch or sponsor from which you can collect the BRP. Remember to bring your passport and travel documents to collect the BRP.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Some Major Considerations</strong></h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Start your visa application process at least three months before your course start date.</li>



<li>Make sure the information you provide is valid and latest.</li>



<li>Maintain communication with the university or relevant education consultant for any query.</li>



<li>You need keen attention to detail while filing a visa application. A single mistake or statement can affect your approval for a UK study visa from Pakistan.</li>
</ul>

<p>A bank statement is a document issued by your bank showing that you have enough funds to stay and study in the UK. Simply put, a bank statement is a record of your bank account activity over some period. It shows the flow of your cash, debits, and credits for a specific period. However, the amount required for a bank statement for UK study visa should stay the same. </p>



<p>Other than asking how much the bank statement is for a UK student visa from Pakistan, you also need a letter from the bank. This letter shows the total amount available and the duration of the bank statement. Moreover, the bank statement also includes the bank&#8217;s signature and statement.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How Much Bank Statement is Required for a UK Student Visa?</strong></h3>



<p>With the bank statement for UK study visa, you need to show that you have enough funds for living and tuition. You must show that the funds were in your account for 28 days. Moreover, the bank statement must not be more than 31 days old from the date you submit the bank statement. However, the UK visa requirements from Pakistan depend upon your course duration and location.</p>



<p>The major bank statement can include your course fees, living costs, and your partner or child&#8217;s living cost if they come with you as a dependent. Here is the break-down of your financial requirements for a UK study visa:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Course Fees:</strong></h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Show proof that you have the full tuition fee in your account for the first year or the entire course. The amount is usually shown on <strong>the CAS letter</strong> you receive from your university.</li>



<li>Your CAS usually shows the initial deposit, for example, £4000. Now, you need to show the remaining fee in the bank statement for the UK study visa.</li>



<li>Total tuition fees usually range from <strong>£10,000 to £40,000 per year</strong> or more, depending upon your university and course. Undergraduate programs typically have lower costs than postgraduate programs.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Living Costs:</strong></h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>If you are studying <strong>in London</strong>, you must have <strong>£1,483 for each month</strong> (this includes the maximum duration of 9 months). Thus, you will need to have and show <strong>£13,347 (</strong>£1,483 X 9).</li>



<li>For <strong>outside London</strong>, you need to have <strong>£1,136</strong> for each month (up to a maximum of nine months). This means you will need to have and show <strong>£10,224</strong> (£1,136 X 9).</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Living Cost for Dependents:</strong></h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>If you are studying outside London, you need to show <strong>£680</strong> for each month (a 9-month maximum duration). The mean <strong>£6,120</strong> (£680 X 9).</li>



<li><strong>£845</strong> each month for studying in London (a maximum of 9 months). This is the mean, <strong>£7,605</strong> (£845 X 9).</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>UK Visa Price in Pakistan for Students</strong></h3>



<p>The UK student visa fees from Pakistan depend upon your course duration. If you are applying from inside the UK and want to extend and switch to a student VISA, the fee is £490. Moreover, you will also need to pay £490 if you apply for a study visa outside of the UK. In short, Pakistani students must pay £490 to apply for a student visa to the UK. However, this amount is not included in the bank statement for UK study visa. You can pay this amount from any bank account in Pakistan or outside.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are Parked Funds?</strong></h3>



<p>Parked funds are the amount in a specific bank account for some time, for example, 28 days. This amount is to meet the visa rules. However, you must show that the amount is yours by showing the bank account in your name and its number. After getting the Visa, you can use the money. Moreover, it&#8217;s essential to save money before your visa application. Saving too little time to get the Visa can result in rejection.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Can I Show the Online Bank Statement for UK Student VISA?</strong></h3>



<p>You can use the online bank statement for UK study VISA from Pakistan. However, the acceptable bank statement for a UK visa must meet some requirements. The statement should be an official document with the bank&#8217;s letterhead, stamp, and signature. Moreover, it should clearly show the account holder&#8217;s details. This means that if you submit an online bank statement, you must print it out and get the bank&#8217;s approval with a stamp and signature.</p>



<p>The bank statement should also include a period of 28 days. The funds in the account should show that you can afford to live and study in the UK. You may also require a cover letter from the bank with your details on it (account number, name, amount, etc.).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to Give Financial Evidence?</strong></h3>



<p>Providing a bank statement for UK study VISA is not enough to get the Visa. You must prove that the financial income is your own. You can give the financial evidence by using:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Personal Account:</strong> Your bank account (current or savings account) should be in the form of a bank statement and a letter from the bank with your name, bank name, and amount.</li>



<li><strong>Partner&#8217;s Account:</strong> Your partner&#8217;s bank account (spouse) if they are in the UK or going with you.</li>



<li><strong>Parent&#8217;s Bank Account:</strong> Your parent&#8217;s bank account with the confirmation letter.</li>



<li><strong>Official Sponsorship:</strong> The money from your official sponsor, if any (for example, the government of Pakistan or a University). The financial sponsor is usually recorded on CAS; if not, you must provide a confirmation letter with the sponsor&#8217;s name, contact, amount, date, and sponsorship period.</li>



<li><strong>A Joint Account:</strong> A joint account with anyone (brother, sister, parents) but with a letter of confirmation that they agree to use it for bank statements.</li>



<li><strong>Loan Amount:</strong> A loan amount from the government of Pakistan or a company/scheme offering student loans. (a loan confirmation letter with the amount within 6 months of applying).</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Financial Documents Required for UK Study VISA</strong></h3>



<p>Applying for a UK study visa from Pakistan includes submitting financial documents to prove that you can support yourself financially. For that reason, you need to submit your monetary documents to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/financial-evidence-for-student-and-child-student-route-applicants">UKVI</a>. Here&#8217;s the list of those:</p>



<p><strong>Original bank statement:</strong> Your bank statement should include your name, account details, bank letterhead, transaction history, stamp, and signature. It shouldn&#8217;t be more than 31 days old.</p>



<p><strong>Bank Letter:</strong> You also need to submit a letter from the bank confirming the validity of your bank statement. The letter should include your name, statement period, account details, and amount.</p>



<p><strong>Proof of Income:</strong> You must provide pay slips or other income-proof documents.</p>



<p><strong>Scholarship/Sponsorship Letter: </strong>If someone sponsors you, you must submit a confirmation letter with the amount they will sponsor.</p>



<p><strong>Letter from Loan Organization: </strong>If you are getting a loan, submit the loan approval letters from the relevant company or organization.</p>



<p><strong>Proof of Property:</strong> If you are using property, you must also include the evidence of property.</p>



<p><strong>Certificates of Deposit:</strong> You must also submit proof if you have a fixed deposit.</p>



<p>Make sure the documents are in their original form and clearly include your details. Moreover, the transaction history should be from the last 28 days, and the bank statement for UK study visa from Pakistan should not be older than 31 days. Also, remember to accompany the bank confirmation letter for the statement.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The 28 Days Rule</strong></h3>



<p>To apply for a UK student Visa from Pakistan, your bank statement should consist of 28 consecutive days. The maintenance amount must have been in your account or your guardian&#8217;s account for the last 28 days. During these 28 days, the amount should not be less than the requisite amount. Any transactions you make should not affect the remaining amount on the statement, or your application will be refused. The counting for 28 days will start from the closing balance to the back and should not be more than 31 days old.</p>



<p>Moreover, the finances in the letter from the bank and the closing balance should match and cannot be older than 31 days. The date of the visa application is not the date on which your bank statement should start. UKVI can ask you for the bank statement while processing your visa application.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What to Do in Case of Insufficient Funds?</strong></h3>



<p>Suppose you do not have enough funds to show in the bank statement for UK study visa to seek education in the UK. Then, you can apply for a scholarship. Many universities in the UK offer scholarships specifically for Pakistani students. For that, you can use the best <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/">education consultants in Islamabad</a>. They will guide you through the universities, scholarships, and requirements.</p>



<p>Another option is to get a loan. Many organizations in Pakistan offer student loans. You can grab the loan and then study and work in the UK to return it.</p>



<p>Of all the options, the best choice is to consult with the best study abroad consultants in Islamabad and get expert advice. They won&#8217;t only help you find the best study options with scholarships but will also assist you with Visas. Moreover, they will guide you on how to live, work, and blend in the UK&#8217;s culture.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who Does Not Need to Submit the Bank Statement for UK Study Visa?</strong></h4>



<p>You do not need to submit the bank statement and meet financial requirements if:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You are applying for a student visa from within the UK.</li>



<li>You are already living in the UK and have a valid visa for 12 months or more on the date you apply for a new UK study Visa.</li>
</ul>



<p>However, keep in mind that not everyone can apply for a UK student visa; therefore, it&#8217;s best to check the requirements before submitting a visa application. Moreover, even if a government or international scholarship organization is supporting you financially, you need to submit written consent.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who Must Need to Meet the Financial Requirements Without Submitting Financial Documents?</strong></h4>



<p>If you have the nationality of the countries available in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-student">Appendix ST, paragraph 22.1 of the Immigration Rules</a>, you must meet the financial requirements. However, you do not need to submit a bank statement for UK study visa during your application. By this, you will be counted in the list of low-risk nationals. In this way, they consider that you will benefit from differentiation arrangements.</p>



<p>The university won&#8217;t need to check the financial statement and will issue the CAS if you apply from within the UK and your own country. However, it is recommended that you keep the bank statement ready in UKVI-approved format in case they ask.</p>



<p>Moreover, if your government and any international scholarship agency support you, you need to submit written consent from them. In this case, you won&#8217;t need to submit the bank statement for UK student Visa.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who Must Meet the Financial Requirements and Submit a Bank Statement?</strong></h4>



<p>You must submit the bank statement while applying for a UK student visa if you do not fit into the above two categories first and if your country is not on the list in Appendix ST paragraph 22.1 of the Immigration Rules, and secondly, if your government and scholarship foundation are not supporting you.&nbsp; Besides, as a Pakistani, submitting a bank statement is necessary; the exemption is only based on scholarship or government funding.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the financial requirements for Studying in the UK?</strong></h4>



<p>To Study in the UK, you must submit a bank statement showing your information and transactions for 28 days. It must not be older than 31 days.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How Much Total Money is Required for a Bank Statement for UK Visa?</strong></h4>



<p>You must show enough funds to support your living and educational expenses. Moreover, the amount should be in your account for 28 days, no more than 31 days old. These expenses are already listed in detail. So now, let&#8217;s make a case scenario:</p>



<p>If your university fee is <strong>£14000</strong> for a bachelor&#8217;s and you are studying within London, your living expenses will be <strong>£13,347</strong>. The total expense you will need is <strong>£27,347. </strong>Living outside London can be less, so you should have this roundabout of this amount in mind.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h2>



<p>You must provide properly scanned copies of your bank statement for your UK study visa. Moreover, a letter from the bank confirming the amount and details is crucial. Primarily, you must submit this bank statement to the university before issuing CAS. The university will check the bank statement and then issue your CAS. Ensure you have 28 days of bank statements no longer than 31 days old. Consult professional education consultants for more information and assistance with your study abroad journey. Have a successful career ahead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) is a fee that most people pay with their UK VISA application. The IHS fee differs from all other fees you pay during your Visa application process. It usually costs £1,035 for the principal applicant and £776 for students and children <strong>from 6th February 2024</strong> according to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/healthcare-immigration-application">UK Government</a>. The IHS cost is the same for adult dependents as the primary visa application. Besides, the amount of IHS depends upon the period you are applying for. You won&#8217;t get a Visa if you haven&#8217;t paid the immigration health surcharge. If the wrong amount is paid being paid, the embassy can delay your UK Visa.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the process of the Immigration Health Surcharge?</strong></h2>



<p>If you pay the immigration health surcharge or are exempt from paying it, you can take national health services in the UK. In short, if you have a visa of more than six months, IHS is a must, and you will get the treatment from an NHS hospital like an ordinary resident of England. However, certain services, such as prescriptions, dental treatment, and eye treatment, won&#8217;t be free won&#8217;t be free. But, if your Visa ends earlier than planned, you will be charged for any <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/">NHS</a> hospital treatment from the time your Visa ends. Besides, if you renew your Visa, you will still pay the charges for any treatment you get after the end of your previous Visa.</p>



<p>Moreover, if you apply for an extension of your Visa, you must pay the IHS further. Similarly, you won&#8217;t have to pay the surcharge if you apply for leave to remain. Consequently, paying the immigration health surcharge does not mean you will get the treatment faster, but it means you can avail of all the services provided by NHS. Doctors will treat you the same way as ordinary residents, and you will be treated according to the urgency of your condition.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>Why Do You Have to Pay the IHS for a VISA?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>If you are not from the UK, such as a Pakistani student or worker trying to apply for a UK Visa, you must pay IHS first. If your period of stay in the UK is more than 6 months, paying IHS is a must. However, if you are applying for a permanent stay in the UK, then the case is different. Besides, if you are applying for entry clearance of 6 months or less, you must have private health insurance with you.</p>



<p>If you are applying from within the UK, paying for an immigration health surcharge is a must in case of a Visa extension, even if it&#8217;s for less than 6 months.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>Immigration Health Surcharge Exemption</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>You can use the National Health Services without paying the immigration health surcharge if:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Applicants for health and care visas, including their dependents, are exempt from IHS. They will not have to pay the IHS fee during their visa filing.</li>



<li>If you are applying for infinite leave to enter and exit from England.</li>



<li>If you will settle down in the UK or apply for permanent immigration.</li>



<li>If you are a member of UK visiting delegates, armed forces, and a diplomat.</li>



<li>If you are a member of the Armed forces of other countries that do not lie under immigration control.</li>



<li>If you are seeking asylum or a domestic worker such as a victim of slavery.</li>
</ol>



<p>There are many others, such as S2 healthcare visitors, frontier work permits, etc. However, as we are dealing with UK Visas for students, you must pay the IHS fee for a UK visa.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>IHS Fee for UK VISA- How Much to Pay?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>The amount of your IHS fee depends upon the period of your visa application. The Visa can last longer than your study duration and employment period. The charge is <strong>£776 per year for students for stays lasting 6–12 months</strong> and <strong>£388 for additional periods of less than 6 months</strong>. <strong>£776 </strong>for visa and immigration applications under 18.</p>



<p><strong>£1,035 </strong>per year for all other visa applications. Moreover, all other applicants must pay <strong>£517.50 </strong>for additional periods of less than 6 months. If you are applying for over 6 months but less than a year, you must pay the full-year IHS Visa Fee.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size"><strong>Example 1:</strong></h4>



<p></p>



<p>If you are enrolling in a 12-month course, your Visa will typically start one month before the course begins and extend to cover the course duration plus an additional four months. This makes your Visa valid for 17 months, requiring you to pay an IHS fee of <strong>£1,164 (£776 + £388)</strong>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size"><strong>Example 2:</strong></h4>



<p></p>



<p>For a three-year undergraduate degree program, the IHS fee is <strong>£776 per year</strong> of your course, plus <strong>£388</strong> for the additional time included in your Visa before and after your course. This totals <strong>£2,716</strong> over three years.</p>



<p>The IHS ensures access to healthcare services throughout your stay in the UK. Be sure to include this cost in your budgeting plans.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size"><strong>Dependents Cost for Immigration Health Surcharge</strong></h4>



<p></p>



<p>Those who are older than 18 will have to pay the same IHS fee as yours. The exact amount of IHS depends upon the period of the Visa you are applying for.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>What Happens if You Do Not Pay IHS?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>If you do not pay an immigration health surcharge fee for UK Visas, you will get an email. It will give you the guidelines on how to pay IHS. The email address will be the same as you put in for the visa application. After receiving the email, you must pay the surcharge within 10 working days if you are in the UK and within seven working days if you are from another country like Pakistan. If the IHS fee is not submitted within the given timespan, your visa application will be turned down immediately.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>How to Pay the Immigration Health Surcharge from Pakistan?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>You need to pay the immigration health surcharge on the date of submission of your visa application. Usually, it comes within the online application form for most visas. As a result, it is impossible to file for a visa without paying the IHS fee. You may need to give the start and end details from the certificate of sponsorship. Or you may need to add the course dates if you are applying for a student visa. After finalizing your application form, you will see a page to pay IHS.</p>



<p>After paying that, you will receive an email with the IHS reference number. You can only use this number once; if you are applying again for VISA, you may need to pay IHS again to get this reference number. After that, you will be returned to the form to make the application fee next. You need a credit or debit card for this. Note that you can&#8217;t apply with cash and bank transfers unless you are a resident of North Korea.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>What&#8217;s the Procedure for an IHS Fee Refund?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>You will get the full IHS fee refund in case:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Suppose you have paid the IHS fee twice or more for the same Visa. The extra amount will be refunded after the Visa is granted.</li>



<li>If you get a visa refusal or withdraw your visa application before its decision, you will get a refund.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>You will get the partial IHS fee refund if your visa application is submitted, but:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You got a shorter visa than you filed for. For example, you asked for two years and got a Visa for one and a half years.</li>



<li>If any dependents are refused a visa, they will get their IHS fee back.</li>



<li>You are applying for a UK Visa again and have already paid the IHS for that period.</li>
</ul>



<p>Moreover, if you have paid the IHS fee twice for the same period of 6 or more than 6 months, the partial refund amount will be rounded to the nearest 6 months. For example, if you paid for 20 months, the refund will be 18 months of IHS. Paying twice for less than 6 months of IHS is not entitled to any refund.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>How Will I Get the Refund, and How long will it Take?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>You don&#8217;t need to take any action if you are entitled to a partial or full IHS refund. The amount will be returned to the account you paid the IHS Fee with. You will usually get the refund within 28 days. However, if you appeal the visa application refusal and ask for a review, the refund can take longer. If your appeal is successful, you will have to pay the IHS again in case it&#8217;s refunded.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>In What Case Do You Won&#8217;t Get a Refund?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>You won&#8217;t get any refund if you</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Withdraw your visa application but have already received the Visa.</li>



<li>You got your VISA but decided not to go to the UK.</li>



<li>You left the UK before the ending period mentioned in the Visa.</li>



<li>You are asked to leave the UK for any reason or mishap.</li>



<li>You are switching to another Visa type or applying for indefinite leave to remain.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>When Can You Start Using NHS with Immigration Health Surcharge? </strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>You can start using the NHS free of cost from the starting date of your Visa. However, IHS payment is a must. If you are in the UK and the Home Office hasn&#8217;t decided on your VISA approval, you might need to pay for NHS. Moreover, you might need to pay for services like prescriptions, dental treatment, and eye care. Besides, to access NHS, you may need to show the BRP (biometric residence permit) or a share code in case of digital immigration status.</p>

<p>Studying in the <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/united-kingdom/">United Kingdom</a> has long been a dream for many international students, including those from Pakistan. However, before embarking on this educational journey, it&#8217;s crucial to understand the intricate process of obtaining a UK student visa. In this guide, we&#8217;ll delve into the UK student visa requirements, particularly focusing on the application process, fees, and essential documents needed for Pakistani applicants.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>Understanding UK Student Visa Requirements</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>1. Application Process</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>To apply for a UK student visa, complete the online application on the official <a href="https://www.britishcouncil.pk/study-uk/student-visa-uk">British Council Pakistan</a>. You can apply up to three months before your intended travel date, and your application date is when you pay the fee. You&#8217;ll need an unconditional offer from a licensed sponsor, financial evidence to cover fees and living expenses, and proof of English proficiency. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>2. Documentation</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Valid Passport:</strong> Applicants must possess a valid passport with at least six months&#8217; validity beyond the intended duration of stay in the UK.</li>



<li><strong>Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS):</strong> Obtaining a CAS from a UK educational institution is mandatory. The CAS serves as proof of acceptance onto a course of study and contains essential details such as the course duration, fees, and sponsorship information.</li>



<li><strong>Proof of English Proficiency:</strong> Most UK universities require international students to demonstrate proficiency in English through standardized tests like the IELTS, PTE, ELLT, TOEFL or Language Cert Academic Selt. Adequate scores must be submitted along with the visa application.</li>



<li><strong>Financial Evidence:</strong> Pakistani applicants must provide evidence of sufficient funds to cover their tuition fees and living expenses in the UK. This typically includes bank statements, sponsorship letters, or scholarship award letters. The exact amount required may vary depending on the duration and location of the course.</li>



<li><strong>Tuberculosis (TB) Test</strong>: Applicants from certain countries, including Pakistan, are required to undergo a tuberculosis test and obtain a certificate from an approved clinic. This certificate must be included in the visa application.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size">3. <strong>Financial Requirements</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>The UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) department specifies minimum financial requirements for student visa applicants.

Additionally, students must demonstrate that they can cover the first year&#8217;s tuition fees.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size">4. <strong>Visa Fees</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>The cost of applying for a UK student visa varies depending on the type and duration of the course. As of [latest update], the standard visa application fee for most courses is £490. However, additional charges may apply for services such as priority processing or courier delivery of documents.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size">5. <strong>Visa Processing Time</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>The processing time for UK student visas can vary depending on the applicant&#8217;s location and the time of year. Generally, it&#8217;s advisable to apply well in advance of the intended start date of the course. This allows sufficient time for processing and potential delays.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size">6. <strong>Health Insurance</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>In addition to the visa fee, students also need to pay the Health Insurance. This grants access to the UK&#8217;s National Health Service (NHS). The calculation of the surcharge amount is based on the duration of the visa and is payable upfront as part of the visa application process.</p>
