<p>Moreover, Malaysia has low living costs and tuition fees with scenic views and the safest environment. So, who wouldn’t like to go there and pursue their career? Here are some major opportunities which you can get as a Pakistani student while studying in Malaysia:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Part-time Work Opportunities in Malaysia for Pakistani Students</strong></h3>



<p>Students cannot work part-time during their semester in Malaysia. However, they can go for it during semester breaks for up to 20 hours per week. For legitimate reasons, you can go for part-time work but with a cash-on-hand basis. Some Malaysian universities do offer paid internships during the semester. That’s another way to earn some bucks during your stay in Malaysia.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cost to Study in Malaysia from Pakistan</strong></h3>



<p>Malaysia promises the highest quality education while offering a cost-effective fee and living expenses. Moreover, all of the Malaysian universities have lower tuition fees than the UK, United States, Japan, and even Singapore. Besides, the living cost is affordable.

The tuition cost of Malaysian universities may vary depending on their rankings and quality of education. However, you can expect the per semester cost from RM 10,000.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Study in Malaysia Without IELTS</strong></h3>



<p>Many universities in Malaysia offer students the option of PTE and IELTS. For some, IELTS is a must-have requirement to gain admission. For Masters, many <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/english-proficiency-test/study-in-uk-universities-without-ielts-for-pakistani-students/">universities accept MOI </a>(Medium of Instruction) from Pakistani Universities. So, you won’t need to take IELTS but submit an English Proficiency Certificate from your previous university. However, for Bachelor’s and Diploma degree programs, IELTS is a must.
