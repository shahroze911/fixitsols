<p>If you want to <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-in-uk/">study in the UK</a> and are concerned about living expenses in the UK, this article is for you. Aligning your budget according to the expenses is crucial to living healthy and happy in the United Kingdom. However, to align, you need to know your requirements. Keep in mind that the living costs can differ depending on the areas of the UK you are going to live in. For example, living in the UK might cost more than living in other areas. Here’s the breakdown of the cost of living in the UK.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-living-expenses-in-the-uk-for-international-students"><strong>Living Expenses in the UK</strong> <strong>for International Students</strong></h2>



<p>There are many websites available where you can count your monthly living expenses in the UK for students. However, here’s where you can find overall expenses and the average budget spent. For more details, you can refer to Expatistan.</p>



<p><strong>Living Cost in London for International Students: </strong>Make sure you have a budget of £1300 &#8211; £1400 per month if you live in London. (excluding the cost of study)</p>



<p><strong>Living Expenses in the UK for Students Outside London: </strong>Expect to spend at least £1,015 &#8211; £1300 per month for living outside London. (excluding the cost of study)</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cost-of-living-support-in-the-uk"><strong>Cost of Living Support in the UK</strong></h3>



<p>The cost of living in the UK is 250% higher than in Pakistan. And rent is 1000% more than in Pakistan. However, you can easily afford the living costs by working part-time. If you don’t have to pay rent and are single, then you can expect monthly costs up to £1,432 (PKR 521,482). However, the living costs for a family of 2 persons are £2,305 (PKR 839,398). Here’s the comprehensive overview:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> All the costs mentioned above are approximate and not the exact amount. The actual expense may vary; however, it&#8217;s best to have the spending amount according to the above details.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-does-study-cost-in-the-uk"><strong>How Much Does Study Cost in the UK?</strong></h3>



<p>The expenses to study in the UK depend upon the course, university, and campus you choose. For example, the cost of social sciences subjects is lower than that of medical and engineering degrees. Thus, the fee structure depends upon the level of education and the place where you are studying. Here are some free estimates for undergraduate and postgraduate:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-undergraduate"><strong>Undergraduate</strong></h4>



<p>The undergraduate tuition fee for international students, such as those from Pakistan, can range from £11000 to £38,000. Usually, the undergraduate degrees are three years long; however, they can vary in some regions, such as Scotland.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-postgraduate"><strong>Postgraduate</strong></h4>



<p>The postgraduate tuition fee for international students can range from £9000 to £30,000. In the UK, you can complete your master’s degree in one year and get a 2-year post-study work visa.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-students-work-in-the-uk-on-a-student-visa"><strong>Can Students Work in the UK on a Student Visa?</strong></h3>



<p>International students are allowed to work 20 hours per week during term time and full-time during holidays. Thus, they can easily afford their living expenses in the UK. Moreover, some universities may also offer on-campus work placements. Some of them also have attached companies that offer jobs. So, it depends upon the student&#8217;s capabilities and how much he/she can earn. Generally, students earn up to £1200 to £1500 per month.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-graduate-visa"><strong>Graduate VISA</strong></h3>



<p>International students can stay in the UK even after completing their degree on a post-study work visa. They can remain in the UK for two years and work there. However, you need to apply for this visa while living in the university before clearing out. The visa application fee is £822, and you might need to pay an <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-abroad/what-is-immigration-health-surcharge-ihs-and-its-cost/">immigration health surcharge</a> (IHS Fee) of £624 for each subsequent year.</p>

The UK is the perfect study destination for Pakistani students and offers you diverse career opportunities. No doubt why our ancestors and founders choose to go to the UK for higher education. You can study, live, work, and pursue your dreams in the UK effortlessly. However, living in the present is best before dreaming of the UK&#8217;s exceptional education and work opportunities. To study in the UK, you need to apply and get admission to a university, and the most crucial step is securing a UK student visa from Pakistan. What&#8217;s your take on the study visa fee, process, and requirements? Let&#8217;s explore!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Types of UK Study Visa from Pakistan</strong></h2>



<p>&nbsp;There are three types of UK student visas from Pakistan. Here&#8217;s the detail:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>General Study Visa (Tier 4)</strong></h3>



<p>For those who are above 16 and have secured admission to a UK educational institution. Besides, the student should have enough money to support his fees and living expenses. Moreover, they can speak and understand English (English language test (IELTS, PTE, Duolingo, etc.).</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When should you apply for a UK study visa?</strong></h4>



<p>The best time to apply for a UK study visa from Pakistan is 3 months before the start of your course at a UK university. You will usually get visa approval or rejection within 3 weeks. So, it&#8217;s best to apply ahead.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What&#8217;s the best time to arrive in the UK?</strong></h4>



<p>The best time to arrive in the UK for a short course, such as 6 months or less, is a week in advance. However, if your course is longer than 6 months, you should arrive up to 30 days before commencing your classes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Child Study Visa</strong></h3>



<p>Students aged less than 16 and more than 4 need a sponsor to study in the UK. You must have consent from your parents if you are 16 or 17, and you may need to provide written evidence.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When should you apply for a UK study visa?</strong></h4>



<p>The best time to apply for a UK study visa from Pakistan is 3 months before classes start.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What&#8217;s the best time to arrive in the UK?</strong></h4>



<p>Suppose the course for child students is less than six months; it&#8217;s best to arrive in the UK one week before the course starts. And if the course is longer than 6 months, it&#8217;s best to arrive up to one month in advance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Short-term Study Visa</strong></h3>



<p>Short-term study visa students usually go there for a language course or a training program. You should also apply for this visa 3 months before the start of the course of the program. Moreover, the best time to arrive in the UK depends upon your travel dates.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>UK Study Visa Requirements from Pakistan</strong></h2>



<p>For a UK Study Visa, you need to meet several requirements. You must have a CAS letter from a UK university. Financial evidence, including your course fee and living expenses, is also necessary. Besides that, you should have proof of English language proficiency to speak, read, and understand English. Here&#8217;s the detail of each step and requirement for a UK study visa:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Select Your Course and University</strong></h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list"></ol>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list"></ol>



<p>&nbsp;The first step to securing a UK study visa from Pakistan is to find the right course and university. Is it overwhelming, right? That&#8217;s not a big deal if you have the best education consultants at your back. Apply for the universities and get an unconditional offer letter from a UK university approved by the UK government. Here are the steps you need to follow:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Contact EduCrest Migration to select the right course and university for upcoming intakes.</li>



<li>We will assign you to our expert UK study consultants, who will guide you through the courses, universities, fee structures, and ranking.</li>



<li>The next step is applying to those universities; we will need little documentation, such as certificates and degrees, CNIC, SOP, and others, to submit the applications to universities.</li>



<li>It&#8217;s best to complete all the requirements, such as CGPA, <a href="https://ielts.org/">IELTS</a> or other English proficiency tests, to get an unconditional offer letter. If you receive a conditional offer letter, you need to meet the university&#8217;s conditions to have an unconditional offer.</li>



<li>After the offer letter, you may be asked to submit the initial deposit and do a university interview. It&#8217;s not a big deal, as our <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/">best education consultants in Islamabad</a>, Pakistan will guide you through everything.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Get a Confirmation of Acceptance (CAS)</strong></h3>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list"></ol>



<p>The next step is to get the CAS letter from the university. After receiving the unconditional offer letter, you need to share a few more documents with your university. After their submission, the university will issue a CAS letter, and then you can apply for a UK study visa from Pakistan. Here&#8217;s what you need to share with your university:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Initial deposit receipt (usually 4000 GBP; the more you submit, the more chances you have for CAS and VISA).</li>



<li>TB test report from UKVI-approved TB test centres in Pakistan.</li>



<li>Bank statement of 28 days (no less than 31 days old). Must use <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-abroad/list-of-ukvi-approved-banks-in-pakistan-to-study-in-uk/">UKVI-approved banks for UK study</a> bank statements.</li>



<li>If your parents are supporting your expenses to study in the UK, you need to submit an Affidavit of support.</li>



<li>A birth certificate or B-form is required to prove your relationship with the sponsor.</li>
</ol>



<p>After these steps, the university will assess all the above documents and issue you a CAS (Confirmation of Acceptance of Studies). This document is a must for your UK student visa from Pakistan. This letter is proof of your admission to a UK university, showing a unique reference number and university details.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Financial Requirements for UK Student Visa</strong></h3>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list"></ol>



<p>You must show proof of finances to apply for a UK study visa from Pakistan. It confirms that the student has enough funds to support their course and living expenses. Here&#8217;s the detail of the <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-abroad/bank-statement-for-uk-study-visa-from-pakistan-in-2025/">bank statement for the UK student Visa</a>:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Course fee for the entire year (after paying initial deposit). Which is usually £10,000 to £40,000 per year.</li>



<li>Living costs in the UK for a maximum duration of 9 months. You must have £1,483 for each month and £13,347 in total as of 9 months if you are living in London.</li>



<li>Living outside London will cost £1,136 each month for a maximum of 9 months. You will need in total £10,224.</li>



<li>In total, you will need £27,347 for the bank statement. However, it&#8217;s not the exact amount.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Documents Required for UK Student Visa</strong></h3>



<p>Preparing all of your documents before applying for a UK student visa from Pakistan is best. The documentation usually includes:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Current Pakistani passport or valid travel document.</li>



<li>CAS letter from the university and other documentation.</li>



<li><a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-abroad/bank-statement-for-uk-study-visa-from-pakistan-in-2025/">Bank statement for UK student visa</a> from Pakistan (sponsor letters, etc.).</li>



<li>English proficiency proof (IELTS, TOEFL, PTE, Language Cert, and others) or MOI letter signed by the university.</li>



<li>A birth certificate or FRC is required to give proof of relationship sponsorship.</li>



<li>TB test results from approved UKVI TB test centre in Pakistan.</li>



<li>Academic documents such as degrees are mentioned on your CAS.</li>



<li>IHS (Immigration Health Surcharge) fee paid slip.</li>



<li>For dependents, you might need to submit extra documentation such as their passports, IHS fees, TB tests, etc.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Tuberculosis (TB) Test</strong></h3>



<p>You also need to submit a TB test as a Pakistani student to study in the UK. The TB test result should not be older than the last 6 months of its submission date. You need to get an appointment at a UKVI-approved clinic in Pakistan, take the test, and get its certificate. The <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-abroad/tuberculosis-testing-in-pakistan-for-uk-visa-guide-for-tb-test/">UKVI-approved TB test centres list</a> is already in EduCrest Migration&#8217;s blog list.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Apply for a UK Study Visa from Pakistan Online</strong></h3>



<p>After completing the documentation and the above requirements, you are ready to apply for a UK visa. You can apply for a UK visa with the help of the best UK study visa consultants in Pakistan. EduCrest Migration&#8217;s experts will help you complete all the requirements and file your visa with a 100% success ratio. However, you can also apply for a UK student visa by following these steps:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Visit the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/student-visa/apply-online">UK Visas and Immigration Website</a> (Gov.UK).</li>



<li>Sign up for the account, select your visa type, which is Tier 4 General, and fill out the application form.</li>



<li>Pay the UK student visa fee from Pakistan, which is £490 as of 2025.</li>
</ol>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>7. Pay Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS)</strong></h4>



<p>While filing your application, you will also pay the IHS fee. This fee is for NHS (National Health Services in the UK) access. The IHS Fee is £776 for a student visa application, including a stay of 6-12 months. £1,035 per year for all other visa applications. You might need to pay more for an additional stay. Learn more about <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-abroad/what-is-immigration-health-surcharge-ihs-and-its-cost/">IHS Fees and Costs</a> here!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>8. Biometric Residence Permit</strong></h3>



<p>Not that after submitting your online student visa application, you need to provide biometric verification (biometric residence permit). Just schedule an appointment at the UK visa application centre for that purpose. Provide your fingerprints and a digital photo of your face there.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>9. Supporting Documents and Interview</strong></h3>



<p>You might be asked to submit the additional supporting documents online at VAC. Get and submit them according to instructions. Moreover, you may be asked for a credibility interview (UK visa interview). In this interview, you will be asked about your study plans, course, reasons for choosing the UK, and plans. This interview checks your credibility and intentions of studying in the UK. Our education consultants help prepare you for this interview with expert guidance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>10. Wait for Visa Approval</strong></h3>



<p>After completing all the above steps, you must wait for the decision. It can take up to 3 weeks to announce the decision. You can also track your Visa application. You will receive a Visa Vignette (sticker) if your UK embassy approves your visa. This sticker means that you can travel to the UK without any restrictions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>11.</strong> <strong>Travel to the UK and Collect BRP (Biometric Residence Permit)</strong></h3>



<p>After getting your visa, just book the air ticket to travel to UK and collect your BRP there. A biometric residence permit (BRP) acts like a CNIC in the UK. It confirms your identity, study rights, and access to any public service. It includes your name, date, place of birth, face, and fingerprints. Besides, it also includes your purpose of staying in the UK.  What types of services, such as NHS, can you access and what expiry date?</p>



<p>You can collect your BRP after arriving in the UK. Collect your BRP before the vignette sticker expires or within 10 days of arrival in the UK. The decision letter includes the name of the post office branch or sponsor from which you can collect the BRP. Remember to bring your passport and travel documents to collect the BRP.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Some Major Considerations</strong></h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Start your visa application process at least three months before your course start date.</li>



<li>Make sure the information you provide is valid and latest.</li>



<li>Maintain communication with the university or relevant education consultant for any query.</li>



<li>You need keen attention to detail while filing a visa application. A single mistake or statement can affect your approval for a UK study visa from Pakistan.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) is a fee that most people pay with their UK VISA application. The IHS fee differs from all other fees you pay during your Visa application process. It usually costs £1,035 for the principal applicant and £776 for students and children <strong>from 6th February 2024</strong> according to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/healthcare-immigration-application">UK Government</a>. The IHS cost is the same for adult dependents as the primary visa application. Besides, the amount of IHS depends upon the period you are applying for. You won&#8217;t get a Visa if you haven&#8217;t paid the immigration health surcharge. If the wrong amount is paid being paid, the embassy can delay your UK Visa.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the process of the Immigration Health Surcharge?</strong></h2>



<p>If you pay the immigration health surcharge or are exempt from paying it, you can take national health services in the UK. In short, if you have a visa of more than six months, IHS is a must, and you will get the treatment from an NHS hospital like an ordinary resident of England. However, certain services, such as prescriptions, dental treatment, and eye treatment, won&#8217;t be free won&#8217;t be free. But, if your Visa ends earlier than planned, you will be charged for any <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/">NHS</a> hospital treatment from the time your Visa ends. Besides, if you renew your Visa, you will still pay the charges for any treatment you get after the end of your previous Visa.</p>



<p>Moreover, if you apply for an extension of your Visa, you must pay the IHS further. Similarly, you won&#8217;t have to pay the surcharge if you apply for leave to remain. Consequently, paying the immigration health surcharge does not mean you will get the treatment faster, but it means you can avail of all the services provided by NHS. Doctors will treat you the same way as ordinary residents, and you will be treated according to the urgency of your condition.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>Why Do You Have to Pay the IHS for a VISA?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>If you are not from the UK, such as a Pakistani student or worker trying to apply for a UK Visa, you must pay IHS first. If your period of stay in the UK is more than 6 months, paying IHS is a must. However, if you are applying for a permanent stay in the UK, then the case is different. Besides, if you are applying for entry clearance of 6 months or less, you must have private health insurance with you.</p>



<p>If you are applying from within the UK, paying for an immigration health surcharge is a must in case of a Visa extension, even if it&#8217;s for less than 6 months.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>Immigration Health Surcharge Exemption</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>You can use the National Health Services without paying the immigration health surcharge if:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Applicants for health and care visas, including their dependents, are exempt from IHS. They will not have to pay the IHS fee during their visa filing.</li>



<li>If you are applying for infinite leave to enter and exit from England.</li>



<li>If you will settle down in the UK or apply for permanent immigration.</li>



<li>If you are a member of UK visiting delegates, armed forces, and a diplomat.</li>



<li>If you are a member of the Armed forces of other countries that do not lie under immigration control.</li>



<li>If you are seeking asylum or a domestic worker such as a victim of slavery.</li>
</ol>



<p>There are many others, such as S2 healthcare visitors, frontier work permits, etc. However, as we are dealing with UK Visas for students, you must pay the IHS fee for a UK visa.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>IHS Fee for UK VISA- How Much to Pay?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>The amount of your IHS fee depends upon the period of your visa application. The Visa can last longer than your study duration and employment period. The charge is <strong>£776 per year for students for stays lasting 6–12 months</strong> and <strong>£388 for additional periods of less than 6 months</strong>. <strong>£776 </strong>for visa and immigration applications under 18.</p>



<p><strong>£1,035 </strong>per year for all other visa applications. Moreover, all other applicants must pay <strong>£517.50 </strong>for additional periods of less than 6 months. If you are applying for over 6 months but less than a year, you must pay the full-year IHS Visa Fee.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size"><strong>Example 1:</strong></h4>



<p></p>



<p>If you are enrolling in a 12-month course, your Visa will typically start one month before the course begins and extend to cover the course duration plus an additional four months. This makes your Visa valid for 17 months, requiring you to pay an IHS fee of <strong>£1,164 (£776 + £388)</strong>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size"><strong>Example 2:</strong></h4>



<p></p>



<p>For a three-year undergraduate degree program, the IHS fee is <strong>£776 per year</strong> of your course, plus <strong>£388</strong> for the additional time included in your Visa before and after your course. This totals <strong>£2,716</strong> over three years.</p>



<p>The IHS ensures access to healthcare services throughout your stay in the UK. Be sure to include this cost in your budgeting plans.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size"><strong>Dependents Cost for Immigration Health Surcharge</strong></h4>



<p></p>



<p>Those who are older than 18 will have to pay the same IHS fee as yours. The exact amount of IHS depends upon the period of the Visa you are applying for.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>What Happens if You Do Not Pay IHS?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>If you do not pay an immigration health surcharge fee for UK Visas, you will get an email. It will give you the guidelines on how to pay IHS. The email address will be the same as you put in for the visa application. After receiving the email, you must pay the surcharge within 10 working days if you are in the UK and within seven working days if you are from another country like Pakistan. If the IHS fee is not submitted within the given timespan, your visa application will be turned down immediately.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>How to Pay the Immigration Health Surcharge from Pakistan?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>You need to pay the immigration health surcharge on the date of submission of your visa application. Usually, it comes within the online application form for most visas. As a result, it is impossible to file for a visa without paying the IHS fee. You may need to give the start and end details from the certificate of sponsorship. Or you may need to add the course dates if you are applying for a student visa. After finalizing your application form, you will see a page to pay IHS.</p>



<p>After paying that, you will receive an email with the IHS reference number. You can only use this number once; if you are applying again for VISA, you may need to pay IHS again to get this reference number. After that, you will be returned to the form to make the application fee next. You need a credit or debit card for this. Note that you can&#8217;t apply with cash and bank transfers unless you are a resident of North Korea.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>What&#8217;s the Procedure for an IHS Fee Refund?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>You will get the full IHS fee refund in case:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Suppose you have paid the IHS fee twice or more for the same Visa. The extra amount will be refunded after the Visa is granted.</li>



<li>If you get a visa refusal or withdraw your visa application before its decision, you will get a refund.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>You will get the partial IHS fee refund if your visa application is submitted, but:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You got a shorter visa than you filed for. For example, you asked for two years and got a Visa for one and a half years.</li>



<li>If any dependents are refused a visa, they will get their IHS fee back.</li>



<li>You are applying for a UK Visa again and have already paid the IHS for that period.</li>
</ul>



<p>Moreover, if you have paid the IHS fee twice for the same period of 6 or more than 6 months, the partial refund amount will be rounded to the nearest 6 months. For example, if you paid for 20 months, the refund will be 18 months of IHS. Paying twice for less than 6 months of IHS is not entitled to any refund.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>How Will I Get the Refund, and How long will it Take?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>You don&#8217;t need to take any action if you are entitled to a partial or full IHS refund. The amount will be returned to the account you paid the IHS Fee with. You will usually get the refund within 28 days. However, if you appeal the visa application refusal and ask for a review, the refund can take longer. If your appeal is successful, you will have to pay the IHS again in case it&#8217;s refunded.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>In What Case Do You Won&#8217;t Get a Refund?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>You won&#8217;t get any refund if you</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Withdraw your visa application but have already received the Visa.</li>



<li>You got your VISA but decided not to go to the UK.</li>



<li>You left the UK before the ending period mentioned in the Visa.</li>



<li>You are asked to leave the UK for any reason or mishap.</li>



<li>You are switching to another Visa type or applying for indefinite leave to remain.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>When Can You Start Using NHS with Immigration Health Surcharge? </strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>You can start using the NHS free of cost from the starting date of your Visa. However, IHS payment is a must. If you are in the UK and the Home Office hasn&#8217;t decided on your VISA approval, you might need to pay for NHS. Moreover, you might need to pay for services like prescriptions, dental treatment, and eye care. Besides, to access NHS, you may need to show the BRP (biometric residence permit) or a share code in case of digital immigration status.</p>
