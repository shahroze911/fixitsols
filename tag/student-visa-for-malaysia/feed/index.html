<p>Are you dreaming of studying abroad but unaware of the pathway? Don’t waste your time and expense by choosing the wrong country. You can achieve career success with global education standards while living abroad. Yes, we are talking about Malaysia. Where other countries cost you bucks for admission fees and visa processing, <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/malaysia/">Malaysia</a> welcomes you with an open heart. With the diverse culture, multiple courses, and world-known universities it offers, it’s a top choice for many international students. Safety and innovation are also the major reasons to study in Malaysia. If you are also wondering how Malaysia is compared to English countries for higher education, this guide is for you!</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>


</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Study in Malaysia?</strong></h2>
<p>


</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>Located between Singapore and Thailand, Malaysia is a hub of education for Southeast Asia. The best thing about Malaysia is the welcoming nature of its people, so students find communication easy. Moreover, the natural beauty and eye-catching landscapes make it the ultimate destination for study. According to <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en">UNESCO</a>, Malaysia is the world&#8217;s 11th most preferred country for education. You can get a degree from Malaysia at the lowest cost possible.</p>

</p>
<p>It means saving millions while taking an education that aligns well with global education standards. We got the reviews of many students studying in the top universities to find out why they chose malaysia. Here are a few primary reasons that make it an ultimate destination for higher education:</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>


</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">1. <strong>It&#8217;s Affordable</strong></h3>
<p>


</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>Affordability is the primary reason to study in Malaysia. You can get high-quality education comparable to the UK and Australia&#8217;s universities with a cost-effective fee structure. Besides, living in Malaysia is affordable. You can easily afford to make a living, from travel expenses to living. Additionally, you can get a single room with a bathroom for a month for RM500. Moreover, the cost becomes lower if you prefer to share your accommodation. </p>
<p>


</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>Other than living expenses, the food quality and prices are also affordable. If you can&#8217;t cook or don&#8217;t have a cooking facility in your dorm, you can also eat from good restaurants. Furthermore, public transportation is less expensive, and you can move around quickly.</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>


</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-transform: capitalize;">2. <strong>Universal Language</strong></h3>
<p>


</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>The official language of Malaysia is <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Indonesian-language">Bahasa</a> Malaysia. However, English is primarily spoken there. Moreover, there are many other languages, such as Mandarin and Tamil. So, you can easily communicate with the locals there. Speaking BM is a plus point, but you can easily survive if you can communicate in English. Therefore, you won&#8217;t have to worry about communication with locals.</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>


</p>
<p><strong>But how language is the reason to study in Malaysia?</strong></p>
<p>


</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>There are many Malaysian universities that offer degree programs in English. Not only this, but these universities also provide English language courses to enhance your grip on writing and speaking English.</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>


</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><strong>3. Diverse Culture</strong></h3>
<p>


</p>
<p>


</p>
<figure id="attachment_3101" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3101" style="width: 740px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://educrestmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/5-12.png" alt="Diverse Culture in Malaysia" width="740" height="420" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3101" class="wp-caption-text">Diverse Culture in Malaysia</figcaption></figure>
<p>With multiple religions and customs, Malaysia offers you a diverse culture. You will find Malays, Chinese, and even Indian people there. About 63.5 percent of the people practice Islam. Moreover, you can see over 18 percent of people practicing Buddhism, 9 percent Christianity, and 6 percent Hinduism. Therefore, you will come across different cultural prospects. A country with multiple religions means you will experience a number of festivals throughout the year. That&#8217;s why diversity is another reason to study in Malaysia.</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>


</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><strong>4. High Education Standards</strong></h3>
<p>


</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>Malaysian education standards meet global requirements. With 35 globally recognized universities ranking in the top 600 universities in the world, Malaysia offers progressive career opportunities. With an affordable fee structure and high-ranked universities comparable to the UK and Canada, this is an ultimate destination for many. A few years back, no one knew about Malaysia for education. However, with an innovative study structure and global approach, Malaysia has carved its way to draft a different story.</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>


</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><strong>5. Incredible Living Standard</strong></h3>
<p>


</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>Studying in Malaysia won&#8217;t only allow you to get a quality education, but it also provides incredible living standards. If you decide to study in Malaysia, that would be the wisest choice you have ever made. We assure you that you won&#8217;t regret your decision, as giving yourself a chance to live independently can never be wrong. Studying abroad is already lonesome; you are away from your family and friends.</p>
<figure id="attachment_3099" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3099" style="width: 740px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://educrestmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/5-11.png" alt="living standard in malaysia" width="740" height="420" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3099" class="wp-caption-text">High living standard in malaysia</figcaption></figure>
<p>


</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>Getting a homey environment and independence in foreign lands purely depends on luck. Therefore, Malaysia offers captivating tourist spots, wildlife, delicious food, spectacular parks, and sandy beaches. Who would like to sit on walls rather than enjoy the freedom of nature?</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>


</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><strong>6. Perfect Weather</strong></h3>
<p>


</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>Being a tropical country with a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, Malaysia&#8217;s weather is sunny throughout the year. Can&#8217;t bear cold or live in extreme temperatures? Choose to study in Malaysia and have the best out of your educational career. The most beautiful thing you will enjoy there is tropical rain showers. The scenic views and alluring sand of the beaches will help you take a break from hectic university schedules.</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>


</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>7. Safety is Priority</strong></h3>
<p>


</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://gfmag.com/data/safest-countries-world/">report by Global Finance</a>, Malaysia is the 27th safest country in the world to live in. Different religions, multiple races, diverse cultural aspects, but the safest communities to live in. So, safety is another primary reason to study in Malaysia. Day or night, it does not matter if you have the safest life throughout your education process.</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>


</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><strong>8. Easy Visa System and Study Permit</strong></h3>
<p>


</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>Obtaining a visa to study in Malaysia is seamless. Their immigration system provides easy immigration procedures for students. Moreover, if you compare visa processing and approval rates to other Western countries, you can get a visa for Malaysia more easily. Additionally, you can also shift your family there while studying. For visa application processing and approval, you can take help from best <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/about-educrest-migration/">visa consultants</a> in Islamabad. Moreover, Malaysian universities also offer scholarships if you need more money to bear expenses.</p>
