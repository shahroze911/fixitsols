<p>If you want to <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-in-uk/">study in the UK</a> and are concerned about living expenses in the UK, this article is for you. Aligning your budget according to the expenses is crucial to living healthy and happy in the United Kingdom. However, to align, you need to know your requirements. Keep in mind that the living costs can differ depending on the areas of the UK you are going to live in. For example, living in the UK might cost more than living in other areas. Here’s the breakdown of the cost of living in the UK.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-living-expenses-in-the-uk-for-international-students"><strong>Living Expenses in the UK</strong> <strong>for International Students</strong></h2>



<p>There are many websites available where you can count your monthly living expenses in the UK for students. However, here’s where you can find overall expenses and the average budget spent. For more details, you can refer to Expatistan.</p>



<p><strong>Living Cost in London for International Students: </strong>Make sure you have a budget of £1300 &#8211; £1400 per month if you live in London. (excluding the cost of study)</p>



<p><strong>Living Expenses in the UK for Students Outside London: </strong>Expect to spend at least £1,015 &#8211; £1300 per month for living outside London. (excluding the cost of study)</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cost-of-living-support-in-the-uk"><strong>Cost of Living Support in the UK</strong></h3>



<p>The cost of living in the UK is 250% higher than in Pakistan. And rent is 1000% more than in Pakistan. However, you can easily afford the living costs by working part-time. If you don’t have to pay rent and are single, then you can expect monthly costs up to £1,432 (PKR 521,482). However, the living costs for a family of 2 persons are £2,305 (PKR 839,398). Here’s the comprehensive overview:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> All the costs mentioned above are approximate and not the exact amount. The actual expense may vary; however, it&#8217;s best to have the spending amount according to the above details.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-does-study-cost-in-the-uk"><strong>How Much Does Study Cost in the UK?</strong></h3>



<p>The expenses to study in the UK depend upon the course, university, and campus you choose. For example, the cost of social sciences subjects is lower than that of medical and engineering degrees. Thus, the fee structure depends upon the level of education and the place where you are studying. Here are some free estimates for undergraduate and postgraduate:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-undergraduate"><strong>Undergraduate</strong></h4>



<p>The undergraduate tuition fee for international students, such as those from Pakistan, can range from £11000 to £38,000. Usually, the undergraduate degrees are three years long; however, they can vary in some regions, such as Scotland.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-postgraduate"><strong>Postgraduate</strong></h4>



<p>The postgraduate tuition fee for international students can range from £9000 to £30,000. In the UK, you can complete your master’s degree in one year and get a 2-year post-study work visa.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-students-work-in-the-uk-on-a-student-visa"><strong>Can Students Work in the UK on a Student Visa?</strong></h3>



<p>International students are allowed to work 20 hours per week during term time and full-time during holidays. Thus, they can easily afford their living expenses in the UK. Moreover, some universities may also offer on-campus work placements. Some of them also have attached companies that offer jobs. So, it depends upon the student&#8217;s capabilities and how much he/she can earn. Generally, students earn up to £1200 to £1500 per month.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-graduate-visa"><strong>Graduate VISA</strong></h3>



<p>International students can stay in the UK even after completing their degree on a post-study work visa. They can remain in the UK for two years and work there. However, you need to apply for this visa while living in the university before clearing out. The visa application fee is £822, and you might need to pay an <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-abroad/what-is-immigration-health-surcharge-ihs-and-its-cost/">immigration health surcharge</a> (IHS Fee) of £624 for each subsequent year.</p>

The UK is the perfect study destination for Pakistani students and offers you diverse career opportunities. No doubt why our ancestors and founders choose to go to the UK for higher education. You can study, live, work, and pursue your dreams in the UK effortlessly. However, living in the present is best before dreaming of the UK&#8217;s exceptional education and work opportunities. To study in the UK, you need to apply and get admission to a university, and the most crucial step is securing a UK student visa from Pakistan. What&#8217;s your take on the study visa fee, process, and requirements? Let&#8217;s explore!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Types of UK Study Visa from Pakistan</strong></h2>



<p>&nbsp;There are three types of UK student visas from Pakistan. Here&#8217;s the detail:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>General Study Visa (Tier 4)</strong></h3>



<p>For those who are above 16 and have secured admission to a UK educational institution. Besides, the student should have enough money to support his fees and living expenses. Moreover, they can speak and understand English (English language test (IELTS, PTE, Duolingo, etc.).</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When should you apply for a UK study visa?</strong></h4>



<p>The best time to apply for a UK study visa from Pakistan is 3 months before the start of your course at a UK university. You will usually get visa approval or rejection within 3 weeks. So, it&#8217;s best to apply ahead.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What&#8217;s the best time to arrive in the UK?</strong></h4>



<p>The best time to arrive in the UK for a short course, such as 6 months or less, is a week in advance. However, if your course is longer than 6 months, you should arrive up to 30 days before commencing your classes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Child Study Visa</strong></h3>



<p>Students aged less than 16 and more than 4 need a sponsor to study in the UK. You must have consent from your parents if you are 16 or 17, and you may need to provide written evidence.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When should you apply for a UK study visa?</strong></h4>



<p>The best time to apply for a UK study visa from Pakistan is 3 months before classes start.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What&#8217;s the best time to arrive in the UK?</strong></h4>



<p>Suppose the course for child students is less than six months; it&#8217;s best to arrive in the UK one week before the course starts. And if the course is longer than 6 months, it&#8217;s best to arrive up to one month in advance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Short-term Study Visa</strong></h3>



<p>Short-term study visa students usually go there for a language course or a training program. You should also apply for this visa 3 months before the start of the course of the program. Moreover, the best time to arrive in the UK depends upon your travel dates.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>UK Study Visa Requirements from Pakistan</strong></h2>



<p>For a UK Study Visa, you need to meet several requirements. You must have a CAS letter from a UK university. Financial evidence, including your course fee and living expenses, is also necessary. Besides that, you should have proof of English language proficiency to speak, read, and understand English. Here&#8217;s the detail of each step and requirement for a UK study visa:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Select Your Course and University</strong></h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list"></ol>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list"></ol>



<p>&nbsp;The first step to securing a UK study visa from Pakistan is to find the right course and university. Is it overwhelming, right? That&#8217;s not a big deal if you have the best education consultants at your back. Apply for the universities and get an unconditional offer letter from a UK university approved by the UK government. Here are the steps you need to follow:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Contact EduCrest Migration to select the right course and university for upcoming intakes.</li>



<li>We will assign you to our expert UK study consultants, who will guide you through the courses, universities, fee structures, and ranking.</li>



<li>The next step is applying to those universities; we will need little documentation, such as certificates and degrees, CNIC, SOP, and others, to submit the applications to universities.</li>



<li>It&#8217;s best to complete all the requirements, such as CGPA, <a href="https://ielts.org/">IELTS</a> or other English proficiency tests, to get an unconditional offer letter. If you receive a conditional offer letter, you need to meet the university&#8217;s conditions to have an unconditional offer.</li>



<li>After the offer letter, you may be asked to submit the initial deposit and do a university interview. It&#8217;s not a big deal, as our <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/">best education consultants in Islamabad</a>, Pakistan will guide you through everything.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Get a Confirmation of Acceptance (CAS)</strong></h3>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list"></ol>



<p>The next step is to get the CAS letter from the university. After receiving the unconditional offer letter, you need to share a few more documents with your university. After their submission, the university will issue a CAS letter, and then you can apply for a UK study visa from Pakistan. Here&#8217;s what you need to share with your university:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Initial deposit receipt (usually 4000 GBP; the more you submit, the more chances you have for CAS and VISA).</li>



<li>TB test report from UKVI-approved TB test centres in Pakistan.</li>



<li>Bank statement of 28 days (no less than 31 days old). Must use <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-abroad/list-of-ukvi-approved-banks-in-pakistan-to-study-in-uk/">UKVI-approved banks for UK study</a> bank statements.</li>

</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Documents Required for UK Student Visa</strong></h3>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Current Pakistani passport or valid travel document.</li>



<li>CAS letter from the university and other documentation.</li>

<li>For dependents, you might need to submit extra documentation such as their passports, IHS fees, TB tests, etc.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Tuberculosis (TB) Test</strong></h3>



<p>You also need to submit a TB test as a Pakistani student to study in the UK. The TB test result should not be older than the last 6 months of its submission date. You need to get an appointment at a UKVI-approved clinic in Pakistan, take the test, and get its certificate. The <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-abroad/tuberculosis-testing-in-pakistan-for-uk-visa-guide-for-tb-test/">UKVI-approved TB test centres list</a> is already in EduCrest Migration&#8217;s blog list.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Apply for a UK Study Visa from Pakistan Online</strong></h3>



<p>After completing the documentation and the above requirements, you are ready to apply for a UK visa. You can apply for a UK visa with the help of the best UK study visa consultants in Pakistan. EduCrest Migration&#8217;s experts will help you complete all the requirements and file your visa with a 100% success ratio. However, you can also apply for a UK student visa by following these steps:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Visit the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/student-visa/apply-online">UK Visas and Immigration Website</a> (Gov.UK).</li>



<li>Sign up for the account, select your visa type, which is Tier 4 General, and fill out the application form.</li>



<li>Pay the UK student visa fee from Pakistan, which is £490 as of 2025.</li>
</ol>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>7. Pay Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS)</strong></h4>



<p>While filing your application, you will also pay the IHS fee. This fee is for NHS (National Health Services in the UK) access. The IHS Fee is £776 for a student visa application, including a stay of 6-12 months. £1,035 per year for all other visa applications. You might need to pay more for an additional stay. Learn more about <a href="https://educrestmigration.com/study-abroad/what-is-immigration-health-surcharge-ihs-and-its-cost/">IHS Fees and Costs</a> here!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>8. Biometric Residence Permit</strong></h3>



<p>Not that after submitting your online student visa application, you need to provide biometric verification (biometric residence permit). Just schedule an appointment at the UK visa application centre for that purpose. Provide your fingerprints and a digital photo of your face there.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>9. Supporting Documents and Interview</strong></h3>



<p>You might be asked to submit the additional supporting documents online at VAC. Get and submit them according to instructions. Moreover, you may be asked for a credibility interview (UK visa interview). In this interview, you will be asked about your study plans, course, reasons for choosing the UK, and plans. This interview checks your credibility and intentions of studying in the UK. Our education consultants help prepare you for this interview with expert guidance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>10. Wait for Visa Approval</strong></h3>



<p>After completing all the above steps, you must wait for the decision. It can take up to 3 weeks to announce the decision. You can also track your Visa application. You will receive a Visa Vignette (sticker) if your UK embassy approves your visa. This sticker means that you can travel to the UK without any restrictions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>11.</strong> <strong>Travel to the UK and Collect BRP (Biometric Residence Permit)</strong></h3>



<p>After getting your visa, just book the air ticket to travel to UK and collect your BRP there. A biometric residence permit (BRP) acts like a CNIC in the UK. It confirms your identity, study rights, and access to any public service. It includes your name, date, place of birth, face, and fingerprints. Besides, it also includes your purpose of staying in the UK.  What types of services, such as NHS, can you access and what expiry date?</p>



<p>You can collect your BRP after arriving in the UK. Collect your BRP before the vignette sticker expires or within 10 days of arrival in the UK. The decision letter includes the name of the post office branch or sponsor from which you can collect the BRP. Remember to bring your passport and travel documents to collect the BRP.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Some Major Considerations</strong></h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Start your visa application process at least three months before your course start date.</li>



<li>Make sure the information you provide is valid and latest.</li>



<li>Maintain communication with the university or relevant education consultant for any query.</li>



<li>You need keen attention to detail while filing a visa application. A single mistake or statement can affect your approval for a UK study visa from Pakistan.</li>
</ul>
