										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) is a fee that most people pay with their UK VISA application. The IHS fee differs from all other fees you pay during your Visa application process. It usually costs £1,035 for the principal applicant and £776 for students and children <strong>from 6th February 2024</strong> according to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/healthcare-immigration-application">UK Government</a>. The IHS cost is the same for adult dependents as the primary visa application. Besides, the amount of IHS depends upon the period you are applying for. You won&#8217;t get a Visa if you haven&#8217;t paid the immigration health surcharge. If the wrong amount is paid being paid, the embassy can delay your UK Visa.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the process of the Immigration Health Surcharge?</strong></h2>



<p>If you pay the immigration health surcharge or are exempt from paying it, you can take national health services in the UK. In short, if you have a visa of more than six months, IHS is a must, and you will get the treatment from an NHS hospital like an ordinary resident of England. However, certain services, such as prescriptions, dental treatment, and eye treatment, won&#8217;t be free won&#8217;t be free. But, if your Visa ends earlier than planned, you will be charged for any <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/">NHS</a> hospital treatment from the time your Visa ends. Besides, if you renew your Visa, you will still pay the charges for any treatment you get after the end of your previous Visa.</p>



<p>Moreover, if you apply for an extension of your Visa, you must pay the IHS further. Similarly, you won&#8217;t have to pay the surcharge if you apply for leave to remain. Consequently, paying the immigration health surcharge does not mean you will get the treatment faster, but it means you can avail of all the services provided by NHS. Doctors will treat you the same way as ordinary residents, and you will be treated according to the urgency of your condition.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>Why Do You Have to Pay the IHS for a VISA?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>If you are not from the UK, such as a Pakistani student or worker trying to apply for a UK Visa, you must pay IHS first. If your period of stay in the UK is more than 6 months, paying IHS is a must. However, if you are applying for a permanent stay in the UK, then the case is different. Besides, if you are applying for entry clearance of 6 months or less, you must have private health insurance with you.</p>



<p>If you are applying from within the UK, paying for an immigration health surcharge is a must in case of a Visa extension, even if it&#8217;s for less than 6 months.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>Immigration Health Surcharge Exemption</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>You can use the National Health Services without paying the immigration health surcharge if:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Applicants for health and care visas, including their dependents, are exempt from IHS. They will not have to pay the IHS fee during their visa filing.</li>



<li>If you are applying for infinite leave to enter and exit from England.</li>



<li>If you will settle down in the UK or apply for permanent immigration.</li>



<li>If you are a member of UK visiting delegates, armed forces, and a diplomat.</li>



<li>If you are a member of the Armed forces of other countries that do not lie under immigration control.</li>



<li>If you are seeking asylum or a domestic worker such as a victim of slavery.</li>
</ol>



<p>There are many others, such as S2 healthcare visitors, frontier work permits, etc. However, as we are dealing with UK Visas for students, you must pay the IHS fee for a UK visa.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>IHS Fee for UK VISA- How Much to Pay?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>The amount of your IHS fee depends upon the period of your visa application. The Visa can last longer than your study duration and employment period. The charge is <strong>£776 per year for students for stays lasting 6–12 months</strong> and <strong>£388 for additional periods of less than 6 months</strong>. <strong>£776 </strong>for visa and immigration applications under 18.</p>



<p><strong>£1,035 </strong>per year for all other visa applications. Moreover, all other applicants must pay <strong>£517.50 </strong>for additional periods of less than 6 months. If you are applying for over 6 months but less than a year, you must pay the full-year IHS Visa Fee.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size"><strong>Example 1:</strong></h4>



<p></p>



<p>If you are enrolling in a 12-month course, your Visa will typically start one month before the course begins and extend to cover the course duration plus an additional four months. This makes your Visa valid for 17 months, requiring you to pay an IHS fee of <strong>£1,164 (£776 + £388)</strong>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size"><strong>Example 2:</strong></h4>



<p></p>



<p>For a three-year undergraduate degree program, the IHS fee is <strong>£776 per year</strong> of your course, plus <strong>£388</strong> for the additional time included in your Visa before and after your course. This totals <strong>£2,716</strong> over three years.</p>



<p>The IHS ensures access to healthcare services throughout your stay in the UK. Be sure to include this cost in your budgeting plans.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size"><strong>Dependents Cost for Immigration Health Surcharge</strong></h4>



<p></p>



<p>Those who are older than 18 will have to pay the same IHS fee as yours. The exact amount of IHS depends upon the period of the Visa you are applying for.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>What Happens if You Do Not Pay IHS?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>If you do not pay an immigration health surcharge fee for UK Visas, you will get an email. It will give you the guidelines on how to pay IHS. The email address will be the same as you put in for the visa application. After receiving the email, you must pay the surcharge within 10 working days if you are in the UK and within seven working days if you are from another country like Pakistan. If the IHS fee is not submitted within the given timespan, your visa application will be turned down immediately.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>How to Pay the Immigration Health Surcharge from Pakistan?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>You need to pay the immigration health surcharge on the date of submission of your visa application. Usually, it comes within the online application form for most visas. As a result, it is impossible to file for a visa without paying the IHS fee. You may need to give the start and end details from the certificate of sponsorship. Or you may need to add the course dates if you are applying for a student visa. After finalizing your application form, you will see a page to pay IHS.</p>



<p>After paying that, you will receive an email with the IHS reference number. You can only use this number once; if you are applying again for VISA, you may need to pay IHS again to get this reference number. After that, you will be returned to the form to make the application fee next. You need a credit or debit card for this. Note that you can&#8217;t apply with cash and bank transfers unless you are a resident of North Korea.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>What&#8217;s the Procedure for an IHS Fee Refund?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>You will get the full IHS fee refund in case:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Suppose you have paid the IHS fee twice or more for the same Visa. The extra amount will be refunded after the Visa is granted.</li>



<li>If you get a visa refusal or withdraw your visa application before its decision, you will get a refund.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>You will get the partial IHS fee refund if your visa application is submitted, but:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You got a shorter visa than you filed for. For example, you asked for two years and got a Visa for one and a half years.</li>



<li>If any dependents are refused a visa, they will get their IHS fee back.</li>



<li>You are applying for a UK Visa again and have already paid the IHS for that period.</li>
</ul>



<p>Moreover, if you have paid the IHS fee twice for the same period of 6 or more than 6 months, the partial refund amount will be rounded to the nearest 6 months. For example, if you paid for 20 months, the refund will be 18 months of IHS. Paying twice for less than 6 months of IHS is not entitled to any refund.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>How Will I Get the Refund, and How long will it Take?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>You don&#8217;t need to take any action if you are entitled to a partial or full IHS refund. The amount will be returned to the account you paid the IHS Fee with. You will usually get the refund within 28 days. However, if you appeal the visa application refusal and ask for a review, the refund can take longer. If your appeal is successful, you will have to pay the IHS again in case it&#8217;s refunded.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>In What Case Do You Won&#8217;t Get a Refund?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>You won&#8217;t get any refund if you</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Withdraw your visa application but have already received the Visa.</li>



<li>You got your VISA but decided not to go to the UK.</li>



<li>You left the UK before the ending period mentioned in the Visa.</li>



<li>You are asked to leave the UK for any reason or mishap.</li>



<li>You are switching to another Visa type or applying for indefinite leave to remain.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>When Can You Start Using NHS with Immigration Health Surcharge? </strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>You can start using the NHS free of cost from the starting date of your Visa. However, IHS payment is a must. If you are in the UK and the Home Office hasn&#8217;t decided on your VISA approval, you might need to pay for NHS. Moreover, you might need to pay for services like prescriptions, dental treatment, and eye care. Besides, to access NHS, you may need to show the BRP (biometric residence permit) or a share code in case of digital immigration status.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Are you preparing to study in the UK, and are you done with the admission process? If you have given your admission responsibility to EduCrest Migration, then understanding some significant steps involving the UK Study visa is crucial. You must follow some rules and regulations set by UKVI to get a UK study Visa. The most important aspects include student bank statements and the TB test for UK visas. In simple words, if you stay in the UK for more than 6 months, then tuberculosis testing is necessary. After that, you can set high expectations for acquiring a UK visa. </p>



<p>Let’s explore some major aspects of tuberculosis testing, the list of approved clinics by UKVI, and the procedure. We will also review the requirements, fees, and methods for TB testing. Let’s dive in.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why is Tuberculosis Testing Necessary for a UK Visa?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The UK has set the rule that anyone coming to the UK, whether for work or study purposes, for more than a period of 6 months must undergo TB testing. However, these limitations are for a few countries, and Pakistan, unfortunately, lies there. If you are a Pakistani student who wants to continue his higher education in the UK, the TB test is mandatory for you. The basic logic behind this test is promoting a healthy and safe environment. The UK is committed to offering public health protection to avoid spreading this lethal disease.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Requirements for TB Test in Pakistan for UK Visa</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>Going for a TB test is also more complicated if you undergo it for a UK Visa. You must fulfil the following requirements before going for the test:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Your CNIC (Computerized National Identity Card) for identification</li>



<li>2 copies of your passport</li>



<li>3 photographs (passport-size, on a white background)</li>



<li>Medical history (Documents, Reports, and others)</li>



<li>Medical certificates (if any)</li>



<li>Fee for TB Test (Cash/Card Payment): </li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Adults:</strong> PKR 11000/-&nbsp; to PKR 15000/-</p>



<p><strong>Children Below 11 Years of Age:</strong> PKR 9000/-</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tuberculosis Testing Clinics Approved by UKVI</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>Your test should be from the clinics approved by the Home Office UK. The UK government will not accept any test certificate which is not from the approved clinic list. Here’s the list of clinics where you can opt for TB tests in Pakistan:</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the Validity of the TB Test for a UK Visa?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>The validity for the Tuberculosis test is 6 months from the test date onwards. However, doing the TB test 3 to 4 weeks before applying for a Visa is recommended. Besides, make sure to put the following information on the TB clearance certificate:&nbsp;</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Complete name</li>



<li>X-Ray date</li>



<li>Date of birth</li>



<li>X-Ray result date</li>



<li>Full name and address of the clinic that provided the certificate. </li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s the procedure for the TB test in Pakistan?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>As a UK Visa applicant, you will undergo a chest x-ray for tuberculosis analysis. If the test has complications, you can request a sputum sample. After that, the doctor will do a tuberculin skin test (Mantoux test, MT). Besides, the procedures for children and pregnant women are a little different. Usually, children under 11 do not undergo X-rays; the clinician decides whether the child has TB or not. For pregnant women, there are many options, such as an extra shield during the x-ray, sputum test, or waiting for delivery. However, note that a sputum test will take up to 8 weeks for results and is a little costlier.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What happens if the TB test for a UK visa is positive?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>If, by any chance, the applicant has TB, they will undergo treatment. Your doctor will refer you for antibiotic treatment. After the treatment, they will be tested again at an extra cost.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What happens if I need to provide the TB test certificate with a visa application?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>Nothing happens other than visa refusal, so we hope you won’t take the risk. The government of the UK sets this TB test requirement, so providing a TB test certificate is necessary. The applicant must provide the valid certificate received from UKVI-approved clinics within six months of the TB test date.&nbsp;</p>
